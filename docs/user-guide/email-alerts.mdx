# Email Alerts

Have I Been Drained offers **free email alerts** to notify you immediately if your Solana wallet is compromised or interacts with known drainer addresses.

## Overview

Email alerts are a proactive security feature that monitors your wallet and sends you instant notifications when:

- Your wallet interacts with known drainer addresses
- Suspicious transaction patterns are detected
- High-risk wallet activity is identified

**All email alerts are completely free** - no payment or subscription required.

## Setting Up Email Alerts

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Click the **"Get Email Alert"** button in the navigation bar
2. Select your Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, etc.)
3. Approve the connection request in your wallet

### Step 2: Verify Wallet Ownership

1. After connecting, you'll be prompted to sign a message
2. This signature verifies that you own the wallet
3. The signature is used only for verification - it doesn't grant any permissions

### Step 3: Provide Your Email Address

1. Enter your email address when prompted
2. Click **"Register Email Alerts"**
3. You'll receive a verification email

### Step 4: Verify Your Email

1. Check your inbox for the verification email
2. Click the verification link in the email
3. Your email alerts are now active!

## How It Works

### Signature Verification

We use **Ed25519 signature verification** to ensure only the wallet owner can register alerts:

1. Our server generates a unique nonce (one-time code)
2. You sign the nonce with your wallet's private key
3. We verify the signature matches your wallet address
4. This proves you own the wallet without exposing your private key

### Email Verification

Email verification ensures alerts are sent to valid addresses:

- Verification links expire after 24 hours
- Only verified emails receive alerts
- You can register multiple emails for the same wallet

### Alert Delivery

When a drain is detected:

1. Our system analyzes your wallet's transaction history
2. If a drainer interaction or high-risk activity is found, alerts are triggered
3. All verified email addresses for your wallet receive an alert
4. Alerts include details about the detected threat and recommended actions

## Managing Your Alerts

### Viewing Your Status

- When connected, click your wallet address in the navigation bar
- A dropdown will show:
  - Your wallet address
  - Your registered email address
  - Verification status

### Disconnecting

To stop receiving alerts:

1. Click your wallet address in the navigation bar
2. Click **"Disconnect"** in the dropdown
3. You'll need to sign a message to confirm disconnection
4. All alerts for your wallet will be removed

### Multiple Emails

You can register multiple email addresses for the same wallet:

- Each email must be verified separately
- All verified emails receive alerts
- Emails are not unique - multiple wallets can use the same email

## Privacy and Security

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received

- Try disconnecting and reconnecting your wallet

### Alerts Not Working

- Try disconnecting and reconnecting

## Best Practices

1. **Use a Dedicated Email**: Consider using a dedicated email for crypto-related alerts
2. **Keep Email Verified**: Make sure your email stays verified to receive alerts
3. **Monitor Regularly**: Check your wallet status periodically
4. **Act Quickly**: If you receive an alert, take immediate action to secure your wallet
