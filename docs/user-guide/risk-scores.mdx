## Risk Score Overview

The risk score is a number from **0 to 100** that represents the overall security status of your wallet. Higher scores indicate greater risk.

## Score Calculation

Risk scores are calculated by aggregating multiple factors:

### Factor Weights

| Threat Type | Weight | Max Contribution |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Known Drainer | 100% | 100 points |
| SetAuthority Attack | 95% | 95 points |
| Unlimited Approval | 90% | 90 points |
| Suspicious Pattern | 70% | 70 points |
| High-Value Transfers | 50% | 50 points |

### Aggregation Method

- Multiple threats are combined using weighted averaging
- Recent threats have higher impact
- Critical threats (drainers) override other factors

## Score Ranges

### 0-20: Very Safe ✅

**Status:** SAFE

No threats detected. Your wallet appears secure.

**What this means:**
- No known drainer interactions
- No suspicious approvals
- Normal transaction patterns
- Low risk of compromise

### 21-40: Safe ✅

**Status:** SAFE

Minor concerns detected, but overall low risk.

**What this means:**
- Some unusual patterns
- Low-value suspicious transactions
- Recommendations for improvement
- Generally safe to use

### 41-60: Moderate Risk ⚠️

**Status:** AT_RISK

Significant security concerns detected.

**What this means:**
- Suspicious approvals present
- Unusual transaction patterns
- Potential compromise indicators
- Action recommended

**Recommended actions:**
- Review all recent transactions
- Revoke suspicious approvals
- Consider creating a new wallet
- Monitor closely

### 61-80: High Risk ⚠️

**Status:** AT_RISK

Serious security threats detected.

**What this means:**
- Multiple threat types present
- High-value suspicious transactions
- Strong indicators of compromise
- Immediate action required

**Recommended actions:**
- Stop using the wallet immediately
- Revoke all approvals
- Transfer assets to a new wallet
- Follow recovery procedures

### 81-100: Critical Risk 🚨

**Status:** DRAINED

Wallet likely compromised.

**What this means:**
- Known drainer interactions
- Authority changes detected
- Assets may be stolen
- Immediate recovery needed

**Required actions:**
- Do not use this wallet
- Follow [Recovery Guide](/user-guide/recovery-guide)
- Report the drainer
- Create new wallet for future use

## Factors Affecting Score

### Time Decay

Older threats contribute less to the score:
- **Recent (0-7 days):** Full weight
- **Recent (8-30 days):** 75% weight
- **Older (31-90 days):** 50% weight
- **Old (90+ days):** 25% weight

### Transaction Volume

Wallets with more transactions may show:
- Higher baseline scores (more activity = more risk)
- More accurate detection (more data)
- Better pattern recognition

### Asset Value

High-value wallets may have:
- More sophisticated attacks
- Higher stakes for attackers
- More comprehensive analysis

## Improving Your Score

To improve your risk score:

1. **Revoke suspicious approvals** - Remove unlimited or risky token approvals
2. **Review transactions** - Verify all transactions are legitimate
3. **Use new wallet** - If compromised, create a fresh wallet
4. **Follow best practices** - Implement security recommendations
5. **Check regularly** - Monitor your wallet security over time

## Score Limitations

<Warning>
  Risk scores are estimates based on available data. They cannot guarantee absolute security or detect all threats.
</Warning>

**Limitations:**
- Based on transaction history only
- Cannot detect future threats
- May miss very recent attacks
- False positives are possible

**Best practices:**
- Use scores as guidance, not absolute truth
- Review evidence for each threat
- Follow recommendations regardless of score
- Check regularly for new threats
