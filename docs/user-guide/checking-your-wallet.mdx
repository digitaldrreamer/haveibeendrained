## What Happens During Analysis?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction Fetching">

    We fetch your wallet's recent transaction history from the Solana blockchain using Helius RPC. We typically analyze the last 50-200 transactions.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pattern Detection">

    Our detection engine analyzes transactions for:
    - Known drainer addresses
    - SetAuthority instructions
    - Unlimited token approvals
    - Suspicious transaction patterns

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Risk Aggregation">

    All detected threats are aggregated into a single risk score (0-100) and overall status (SAFE, AT_RISK, or DRAINED).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recommendations">

    Based on detected threats, we provide actionable recommendations to secure your wallet.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding the Analysis Time

Analysis typically takes **10-15 seconds** because:

- We fetch transaction history from the blockchain
- We parse and analyze each transaction
- We check against our on-chain drainer registry
- We aggregate risk factors and generate recommendations

<Warning>
  If analysis takes longer than 30 seconds, there may be an issue. Try refreshing the page or contact support.
</Warning>

## Tips for Best Results

- **Use the full wallet address** - Don't use shortened or truncated addresses
- **Check regularly** - New threats can appear at any time
- **Review recommendations** - Even if your wallet is safe, review best practices
- **Report drainers** - Help protect others by reporting malicious addresses

## Troubleshooting
