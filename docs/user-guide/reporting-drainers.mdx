## Why Report Drainers?

By reporting drainer addresses, you help:
- **Protect others** from the same attacks
- **Build the registry** of known threats
- **Improve detection** for everyone
- **Create accountability** on-chain

## How to Report

### Via Website

1. **Check the drainer address** first to confirm it's malicious
2. **Navigate to the report page** on haveibeendrained.org
3. **Submit the drainer address** and transaction evidence
4. **Pay the anti-spam fee** (0.01 SOL) to submit on-chain

### Via On-Chain Registry

Reports are stored on-chain using our Anchor program:

- **Immutable** - Cannot be deleted or modified
- **Verifiable** - Anyone can verify reports
- **Decentralized** - No single point of control
- **Anti-spam** - 0.01 SOL fee prevents abuse

## What to Report

Report addresses that have:
- **Stolen assets** from wallets
- **Drained tokens** via approvals
- **Changed authorities** without permission
- **Engaged in malicious activity**

### Required Information

When reporting, provide:
- **Drainer address** - The malicious wallet address
- **Transaction signatures** - Evidence of the attack
- **Amount stolen** - Approximate value (optional)
- **Attack type** - What kind of attack occurred

## Anti-Spam Protection

To prevent false reports, we require:
- **0.01 SOL fee** per report (paid on-chain)
- **Transaction evidence** to verify the report
- **Community verification** through multiple reports

<Info>
  The 0.01 SOL fee helps prevent spam while keeping reporting accessible. Fees go to maintaining the registry.
</Info>

## Report Verification

Reports are verified through:
1. **Transaction analysis** - We check the provided evidence
2. **Pattern matching** - Compare with known attack patterns
3. **Community consensus** - Multiple reports increase confidence
4. **On-chain storage** - Immutable record on Solana

## Viewing Reports

You can view all reports:
- **On the website** - Browse reported drainers
- **On-chain** - Query the Anchor program directly
- **Via API** - Programmatic access to reports

## Best Practices

### Before Reporting

- **Verify the address** is actually malicious
- **Gather evidence** (transaction signatures)
- **Check if already reported** to avoid duplicates
- **Ensure you have 0.01 SOL** for the fee

### When Reporting

- **Be accurate** - Provide correct information
- **Include evidence** - Transaction signatures help
- **Be specific** - Describe what happened
- **Follow up** - Check if your report was accepted

### After Reporting

- **Share with others** - Help spread awareness
- **Monitor the address** - See if it's still active
- **Update if needed** - Provide additional information

## Privacy & Anonymity

<Info>
  Reports are public and on-chain, but:
  - Your wallet address is recorded (for anti-spam)
  - Personal information is not required
  - Reports are pseudonymous
  - You can use a separate wallet for reporting
</Info>

## Impact of Reporting

Your reports help:
- **Immediate protection** - Addresses are flagged quickly
- **Long-term security** - Build comprehensive threat database
- **Research** - Help understand attack patterns
- **Prevention** - Enable proactive security measures
