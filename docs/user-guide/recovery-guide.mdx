<Steps>
<Step title="Stop using the wallet">

**Do not** make any new transactions from the compromised wallet. This includes:
- Sending tokens
- Approving new transactions
- Interacting with dApps
- Any blockchain activity

</Step>

<Step title="Assess the damage">

Review the analysis results to understand:
- Which assets were affected
- When the compromise occurred
- What type of attack happened
- Transaction evidence links

</Step>

<Step title="Revoke all approvals">

Revoke all token approvals immediately:

1. Go to [Solana Token Approvals](https://solscan.io/token-approval-checker)
2. Enter your wallet address
3. Revoke all active approvals
4. Use [Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) for additional tools

<Warning>
  Revoking approvals may cost a small amount of SOL in transaction fees. This is necessary to prevent further theft.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Transfer remaining assets">

If any assets remain:
1. Create a **new wallet** (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
2. Transfer all remaining assets to the new wallet
3. Do not reuse the compromised wallet

</Step>

<Step title="Report the drainer">

Help protect others by reporting the drainer:
1. Go to the [Report Drainer](/user-guide/reporting-drainers) page
2. Submit the drainer address
3. Provide transaction evidence

</Step>
</Steps>

## Recovery by Attack Type

### Known Drainer Attack

**What happened:** Your wallet interacted with a known drainer address.

**Recovery steps:**
1. Immediately revoke all approvals
2. Transfer any remaining assets
3. Create a new wallet
4. Report the drainer address
5. Review how the interaction occurred (phishing, malicious dApp, etc.)

### SetAuthority Attack

**What happened:** An unauthorized authority change was detected.

**Recovery steps:**
1. **Critical:** Revoke all token approvals immediately
2. Check if you can still control the wallet
3. Transfer assets to a new wallet
4. Review recent transactions to find the attack vector
5. Change all related passwords and keys

### Unlimited Approval Attack

**What happened:** A token approval with unlimited spending was granted.

**Recovery steps:**
1. Revoke the unlimited approval immediately
2. Check if tokens have been drained
3. If tokens remain, transfer them to a new wallet
4. Review which dApp or transaction granted the approval
5. Avoid that dApp/service in the future

## Creating a New Wallet

    5. Update all dApp connections to use the new wallet

  <Accordion title="Hardware Wallet">

    For maximum security, consider using a hardware wallet:
    1. Purchase a Ledger or Trezor
    2. Set up a new Solana account
    3. Transfer assets to the hardware wallet
    4. Use hardware wallet for all future transactions

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Preventing Future Attacks

### Best Practices

1. **Never share your private key or seed phrase**
2. **Verify dApp URLs** before connecting
3. **Use specific amount approvals** instead of unlimited
4. **Review transactions regularly**
5. **Use hardware wallets** for large holdings
6. **Check wallet security** periodically with Have I Been Drained

### Approval Management

- **Revoke unused approvals** regularly
- **Use specific amounts** when approving
- **Set expiration dates** if supported
- **Monitor approval activity**

### Transaction Verification

- **Verify all transaction details** before signing
- **Check recipient addresses** carefully
- **Be cautious of unexpected transactions**
- **Review transaction history** regularly
