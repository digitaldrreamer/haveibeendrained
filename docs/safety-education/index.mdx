## Why Story-Driven Education?

- **Relatable characters** - People like you facing real situations
- **Step-by-step narratives** - See exactly how scams unfold
- **Emotional connection** - Understand the impact through human stories
- **Memorable lessons** - Stories stick better than abstract warnings
