title: "Hacks"
description: "Understanding technical exploits, phishing, wallet drainers, and unauthorized access attacks"
---

## Definition

**Pronunciation:** /haks/

**Hacks** are user-facing incidents where crypto assets are lost due to unauthorized access, malicious software, or tricking users into signing/approving transactions that enable theft. While the term "hack" traditionally implies technical exploitation, most crypto "hacks" against individual users involve sophisticated social engineering combined with wallet transaction manipulation.

## What It Covers

This category includes attacks that:

- Compromise wallets through phishing or malicious approvals
- Install malware or fake applications to steal credentials
- Manipulate users into granting unauthorized permissions
- Exploit trust to gain access to accounts or private keys
- Use technical tricks to intercept or redirect transactions

## What It Does NOT Cover

- **Investment scams** where users willingly send funds (see [Frauds](/safety-education/categories/frauds))
- **Threat-based extortion** demanding payment (see [Blackmail](/safety-education/categories/blackmail))
- **Privacy surveillance** without immediate asset loss (see [Privacy & Tracking](/safety-education/categories/privacy-tracking))

## Why It Matters

Hacks represent the **largest category of individual crypto losses** by volume. Unlike traditional financial systems with chargebacks or fraud protection, blockchain transactions are irreversible. Once a hacker gains control of your wallet or approvals, your funds are gone permanently.

According to industry research:
- Wallet drainer campaigns have stolen **$59M+ from individual users** in single operations
- Phishing attacks are the **#1 attack vector** against crypto users
- Over **10,000+ victims** have fallen for drainer scams in major campaigns

## Subcategories & Scam Types

### Phishing & Typosquatting

**Description:** Attacks that use fake websites, emails, or domains to trick users into entering credentials or connecting wallets to malicious contracts.

**Common scam types:**
- **Typosquatting domains** - Look-alike URLs with tiny spelling differences (e.g., `arnrnatina.com` vs `ammatina.com`)
- **Email/message phishing** - Fake support emails, grant notifications, or airdrop claims
- **QR code replacement** - Swapping legitimate payment QRs with attacker addresses
- **Fake login pages** - Cloned exchange or wallet sites designed to steal credentials

### Wallet Drainers & Malicious Contracts

**Description:** Smart contracts or scripts designed to drain all tokens from a wallet after the user approves a seemingly legitimate transaction.

**Common scam types:**
- **Unlimited token approvals** - Contracts requesting `setApprovalForAll` or unlimited spending rights
- **"Sign to verify" traps** - Malicious signature requests disguised as ownership verification
- **NFT mint drainers** - Fake NFT minting sites that drain wallets during the "mint" process
- **Fake DEX/router approvals** - Counterfeit DeFi platforms requesting dangerous permissions

</CardGroup>

**Key insight:** Modern wallets show transaction popups, but many users don't understand what "approve" means. Drainers exploit this by making dangerous approvals look routine.

---

### Malware & Fake Applications

**Description:** Software that infects devices to steal wallet credentials, modify clipboard contents, or monitor user activity.

**Common scam types:**
- **Fake wallet apps/extensions** - Counterfeit versions of MetaMask, Phantom, or other wallets on app stores
- **Clipboard hijackers** - Malware that replaces copied wallet addresses with attacker addresses
- **Keyloggers & screen capture** - Programs that record keystrokes or screenshots to steal seed phrases
- **Remote access trojans** - Software granting attackers full device control

**Prevention:** Only download wallets from official sources, verify publisher certificates, and use hardware wallets for large holdings.

---

### Account Takeover

**Description:** Attacks that compromise Web2 accounts (email, phone, exchange accounts) to gain access to crypto holdings.

**Common scam types:**
- **SIM swap attacks** - Hijacking phone numbers to bypass 2FA and reset exchange passwords
- **Email compromise** - Hacking email accounts to reset passwords or authorize withdrawals
- **Fake 2FA reset support** - Social engineering to convince support teams to disable 2FA
- **Session hijacking** - Stealing active login sessions through browser exploits

**Note:** Even if your crypto is on-chain, many users store funds on centralized exchanges vulnerable to account takeover.

## User Safety Basics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Before Connecting Your Wallet" icon="plug">
    - **Bookmark official sites** and only access them from bookmarks, never email links
    - **Verify URLs character-by-character** - look for extra letters, swapped characters, or wrong TLDs
    - **Use separate wallets** - Keep a "hot wallet" with small amounts for testing new sites; store bulk funds in cold storage
    - **Check contract addresses** on blockchain explorers - verify age, verification status, and other interactions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="During Wallet Interactions" icon="hand">
    - **Read every approval carefully** - Never approve "unlimited" spending unless you know exactly why
    - **Enable transaction simulation** - Use wallets like Rabby or Fire that show what a transaction will do
    - **Question urgency** - Legitimate projects rarely demand immediate action with countdown timers
    - **Verify through multiple channels** - If you receive a notification, log into the official platform independently
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="After Suspicious Activity" icon="alert-triangle">
    - **Revoke approvals immediately** - Use tools like Revoke.cash or Etherscan's token approval checker
    - **Move remaining funds** to a fresh wallet with a new seed phrase
    - **Report the address** to ChainAbuse and your wallet provider
    - **Document everything** - Save URLs, transaction hashes, emails, and screenshots
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Relatable Examples

> **The Grant Applicant:** Lisa applied to Web3 grants for her business. She received an email claiming approval and clicked to "verify her wallet." The URL looked right at a glance: `arnrnatina-funds.com` instead of `ammatina-funds.com`. She approved what she thought was a verification, but it was unlimited token approval. Within minutes, **$180,000 was gone.**

> **The NFT Collector:** A Discord server claimed to be launching an exclusive NFT project. The mint link was shared by accounts that looked official. During the "mint," the site requested approval. The collector lost **all NFTs and tokens** from their wallet—the contract was a drainer.

## Recommended Controls

### For Individuals
- **Hardware wallets** (Ledger, Trezor) for holdings over $1,000
- **Multi-sig wallets** for business or team funds

- **Regular approval audits** - Revoke old/unused permissions quarterly

### For Teams & Organizations
- **Security training** on phishing and approval risks
- **Transaction approval processes** requiring multiple reviews for large amounts
- **Whitelist-only wallet connections** - Pre-approve trusted dApp domains
- **Incident response plan** with clear steps for compromise scenarios

## What To Do If You've Been Hacked

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stop Using the Compromised Wallet">
    Do NOT send more transactions from the affected wallet - the attacker may be monitoring it.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Revoke All Approvals">
    Use Revoke.cash, Etherscan, or your wallet's approval manager to revoke permissions immediately. Start with high-value tokens (USDC, USDT, WETH).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Move Remaining Assets">
    Transfer any remaining funds to a **brand new wallet** with a fresh seed phrase. Never reuse the compromised wallet.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Report the Attack">
    - Report to ChainAbuse: Flag the attacker's address
    - Report to your wallet provider: Help prevent others from falling victim
    - Report to law enforcement: FBI IC3 (ic3.gov) for US victims
    - Check your wallet: [Have I Been Drained?](https://haveibeendrained.org)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Preserve Evidence">
    Screenshot everything: URLs, transaction hashes, emails, messages. This helps investigations and warns others.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share Your Story">
    Consider sharing anonymously to help educate others. Your experience can prevent future victims.
  </Step>
</Steps>
