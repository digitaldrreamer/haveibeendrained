title: "Privacy & Tracking Attacks"
description: "Understanding surveillance, dusting attacks, scam tokens, and on-chain tracking that sets you up as a future target"
---

## Definition

**Pronunciation:** /ˈpraɪ.və.si ənd ˈtræk.ɪŋ əˌtæks/ ("PRY-vuh-see and TRACK-ing uh-TAKS")

**Privacy and tracking attacks** are behaviors where scammers, analytics tools, or adversaries try to follow your on-chain activity, cluster your wallets, or tempt you into risky interactions that reveal more about your identity and holdings. These attacks might not steal funds immediately, but they **set you up as a future target** for phishing, fraud, or extortion.

## What It Covers

This category includes attacks that:

- Send tiny "dust" amounts of crypto to trace how you move funds and cluster addresses
- Airdrop scam tokens or NFTs to tempt you into connecting to malicious contracts
- Use on-chain data combined with social media to deanonymize wallet owners
- Deploy data-harvesting "free tools" that monitor wallets and build user profiles
- Track spending patterns to identify high-value targets for sophisticated attacks

## What It Does NOT Cover

- **Direct theft** via fraud or technical hacks (see [Frauds](/safety-education/categories/frauds) and [Hacks](/safety-education/categories/hacks))
- **Legitimate analytics** or block explorers with clear privacy policies used for research
- **Normal blockchain transparency** that's inherent to public ledgers

## Why It Matters

In crypto, **your addresses are public by design**. Every transaction you make is permanently recorded on the blockchain for anyone to see. While this transparency powers trustless systems, it also creates privacy risks.

Attackers can combine tiny clues—like:
- Dust transactions you ignore
- Scam tokens sitting in your wallet
- Social media posts mentioning transactions
- Patterns in when and how you transact

...to build a detailed profile on you. That profile helps them:
- **Target you with tailored phishing** that references your real activity
- **Identify high-value wallets** worth attacking with sophisticated techniques
- **Link your wallet** to your real identity for doxxing or extortion
- **Time attacks** for when you're most likely to be less vigilant

## Subcategories & Scam Types

### Dusting Attacks

**Description:** Sending a tiny amount of crypto ("dust") to your wallet to track how it moves or to tempt you into interacting with a malicious address. Often used to cluster multiple addresses as belonging to the same user.

**Common scam types:**
- **Bitcoin-style dusting** - Tiny BTC amounts sent to link addresses when you consolidate UTXOs
- **Token dusting on EVM chains** - Random tokens sent to bait you into DEX interactions or "cleanup" sites
- **Cross-chain dusting** - Coordinated dusting across multiple blockchains to build identity graphs
- **Dust with phishing messages** - Token names or memo fields containing scam URLs

    How tiny transactions can deanonymize wallet owners
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**How it works:**
1. Attacker sends 0.00001 BTC or 1 random token to thousands of addresses
2. When you later consolidate or move funds, dust mixes with your real transactions
3. Attacker traces the dust to link multiple addresses as belonging to same person
4. Profile built over time reveals patterns, wealth, and potentially identity

**Key insight:** The dust itself isn't directly harmful—it's the **tracking and profiling** it enables that creates risk.

### Scam Airdrops & Malicious Tokens

**Description:** Airdropped tokens or NFTs that appear in your wallet without consent, where interacting with them (selling, swapping, "claiming rewards") routes you through malicious contracts or phishing sites.

**Common scam types:**
- **Airdropped tokens leading to drainer sites** - Token appears with instructions to "claim value" on a scam website
- **Suspicious NFTs with phishing URLs** - NFT metadata contains links to fake marketplaces
- **"Honeypot" tokens** - Can be bought but not sold; attempts to sell fail or route through drainer
- **Fake high-value tokens** - Appear worth thousands in your wallet, but selling requires dangerous approvals

**Typical flow:**
1. Wake up to 10,000 "UltraGainToken" or a suspicious NFT in your wallet
2. Check price—wallet shows it's "worth" $5,000
3. Try to sell on a DEX or fake site linked in token info
4. Approval requested seems normal but drains your wallet

**Important:** You **cannot prevent** random tokens from appearing in your wallet—anyone can send tokens to any address. The danger is in **interacting** with them.

---

### On-Chain OSINT & Targeting

**Description:** Using open blockchain data combined with social media and off-chain clues to identify who controls a wallet, how wealthy they are, and which attacks they're most vulnerable to.

**Common scam types:**
- **"Whale" wallet targeting** - Identifying large holders for SIM swap attacks and sophisticated drainer campaigns
- **Social media correlation** - Matching wallet addresses to Twitter/X profiles that post transaction screenshots
- **Deanonymization through patterns** - Identifying users through transaction timing, amounts, and recipient patterns
- **NFT holder profiling** - Tracking NFT collectors across platforms to build marketing or attack profiles

**Real-world example:** A trader tweets "Just bought 10 ETH of [token]" → Blockchain analysts find matching transaction → Link address to Twitter profile → Build complete trading history → Craft personalized phishing email referencing specific trades.

**Why it works:** Most users don't realize how much their on-chain activity reveals, especially when combined with public social media posts.

## User Safety Basics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Wallet Hygiene" icon="wallet">
    - **Never assume your wallet address is private** - Treat it like a public username, not a password
    - **Use different wallets for different purposes** - Separate public activity (NFT minting, social interactions) from private holdings
    - **Create fresh wallets for sensitive holdings** - Don't reuse addresses that are linked to your identity
    - **Label wallets clearly** - Know which ones are "public" vs "private"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handling Unexpected Tokens" icon="coins">
    - **Ignore unexpected airdropped tokens and NFTs** - Don't try to "clean" or sell them
    - **Do NOT click links** in token names, NFT descriptions, or transaction memos
    - **Use wallet "hide" features** - Most wallets let you hide spam tokens from view
    - **Only use trusted cleanup tools** - If absolutely necessary, use well-known services like Phantom's burn feature (Solana)
    - **Never connect to unknown sites** promising to "remove spam tokens for free"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Social Media & Public Sharing" icon="share-nodes">
    - **Avoid posting wallet addresses** publicly unless necessary for your work/brand
    - **Don't share transaction screenshots** that reveal addresses or amounts
    - **Be cautious about posting balances** or portfolio wins
    - **Use privacy tools** when sharing on-chain activity (strip metadata, crop carefully)
    - **Consider pseudonymous accounts** for crypto activity separate from main identity
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Relatable Examples

> **The Dust Trap:** Ngozi wakes up to hundreds of random tokens in her wallet. Annoyed, she googles "how to remove dust tokens" and finds a site promising "auto-sell all spam tokens." She connects her wallet, approves what seems like a cleanup transaction, and **her entire wallet is drained.** The "cleanup" site was a drainer.

> **The Whale Target:** A prominent trader regularly posts their wallet address on X to show portfolio performance. Months later, they receive targeted phishing emails that reference **specific trades they made**, making the scam feel legitimate. The attacker built a complete profile using public blockchain data.

> **The NFT Phishing Airdrop:** An artist receives an NFT called "Exclusive Collab Invitation" with a link to a "verification portal." Excited about the opportunity, they click and connect their wallet to verify ownership. The portal was a drainer—**all NFTs and tokens stolen.**

## Recommended Controls

### For Individuals
- **Separate public and private wallets** - Keep a "face" wallet for social interactions and a secure wallet for holdings
- **Use privacy tools when necessary** - Mixers, privacy coins, or privacy-focused chains (understand legal/regulatory implications)
- **Hide spam tokens immediately** - Don't let them distract or tempt you
- **Review what you share publicly** - Audit your social media for wallet addresses, transaction screenshots, and balance posts
- **Assume observers** - If you're transacting large amounts, assume someone is watching and planning

### For High-Profile Users
- **Dedicated hot wallet** - Use a small-balance wallet for all public interactions and testing
- **Cold storage for holdings** - Hardware wallets or multi-sig for anything significant
- **OPSEC discipline** - Never link cold storage addresses to your public identity
- **Privacy-focused practices** - Use fresh addresses, avoid address reuse, consider privacy protocols
- **Security audit** - Periodic review of what's publicly knowable about your holdings

### For Projects & Communities
- **Educate users about dust** - Explain that random tokens appearing is normal but interaction is dangerous
- **Official communication channels** - Make it clear official airdrops NEVER require approval or payment
- **Verified contract addresses** - Publish official contract addresses on verified channels
- **Warning systems** - Alert community when scam airdrops targeting your users are discovered

## What To Do About Privacy & Tracking

<Steps>
  <Step title="Accept That Public Blockchains Are Transparent">
    You cannot prevent people from viewing your transactions. Privacy comes from **separation, not secrecy**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Separate Your Wallets Immediately">
    Create distinct wallets:
    - **Public/Social**: For NFT minting, community activity, small transactions
    - **Private/Holdings**: For long-term savings, never linked to your identity
    - **Testing**: For trying new dApps with minimal funds
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Hide or Ignore Spam Tokens">
    Use your wallet's built-in features to hide unwanted tokens. DO NOT:
    - Click links in token names or NFT metadata
    - Connect to "cleanup" sites
    - Try to sell or swap spam tokens
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Audit Your Public Footprint">
    Search for:
    - Social media posts mentioning your wallet addresses
    - Screenshots with visible addresses or transaction hashes
    - Forum posts where you shared wallet info
    
    Consider deleting or editing to reduce linkability.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Privacy Tools Responsibly">
    If you need enhanced privacy:
    - Fresh wallets for each major use case
    - Privacy protocols like Tornado Cash (be aware of legal/regulatory status)
    - Non-custodial privacy wallets
    
    **Important**: Privacy ≠ Anonymity for illegal activity. Follow local laws.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Stay Vigilant for Targeted Attacks">
    If you're a known crypto user, expect:
    - Personalized phishing mentioning your real activity
    - Social engineering attacks using public information
    - Higher-effort scams because you're a valuable target
  </Step>
</Steps>
