title: "Frauds"
description: "Understanding deception-based schemes, investment scams, romance frauds, and fake projects"
---

## Definition

**Pronunciation:** /frawdz/

**Frauds** are deception-based schemes that manipulate trust and promise financial gain to steal funds. Unlike hacks that exploit technical vulnerabilities, frauds rely on **social engineering, false promises, and relationship building** to convince victims to willingly send crypto or invest in fake opportunities.

## What It Covers

This category includes attacks that:

- Persuade victims to invest in fake platforms or projects
- Build romantic or mentor relationships to enable financial exploitation
- Create fake tokens, NFTs, or projects that are abandoned after fundraising
- Impersonate legitimate brands, influencers, or support teams
- Promise unrealistic returns or "guaranteed" profits
- Exploit victims who have already lost funds by offering fake recovery services

## What It Does NOT Cover

- **Technical exploits** that drain wallets via malicious contracts (see [Hacks](/safety-education/categories/hacks))
- **Threat-based extortion** demanding payment under duress (see [Blackmail](/safety-education/categories/blackmail))
- **Surveillance without immediate financial loss** (see [Privacy & Tracking](/safety-education/categories/privacy-tracking))

## Why It Matters

Frauds represent the **highest individual losses** in crypto scams. FBI data shows investment fraud is the **#1 category** for crypto scam losses, with:

- **$5.6 billion lost** to crypto scams in the US alone (2023)
- **Average romance-to-crypto scam loss:** $1,300 to $450,000 per victim
- **Pig butchering scams** can drain entire life savings over months
- Victims often experience **secondary victimization** through recovery scams

Unlike quick-hit hacks, frauds often involve **weeks or months of manipulation**, making the emotional and financial impact devastating.

## Subcategories & Scam Types

### Investment & Fake Trading Platforms

**Description:** Scams that promise high returns, guaranteed profits, or exclusive investment opportunities through fake or manipulated platforms.

**Common scam types:**
- **Fake trading platforms** - Websites or apps that show fake profits but never allow withdrawals
- **Guaranteed-return promises** - "Double your crypto in 30 days" or similar impossible offers
- **Referral/MLM crypto schemes** - Pyramid structures requiring recruitment for returns
- **Liquidity mining fraud** - Fake DeFi protocols promising unsustainable APYs
- **Withdrawal blocks with "tax" demands** - Platforms requiring "tax payments" or "fees" to withdraw (which never arrive)

**Key pattern:** These scams show convincing dashboards with "growing balances," but when victims try to withdraw, the platform demands additional payments or simply disappears.

---

### Romance & Relationship Scams

**Description:** Long-term manipulation through romantic or mentor relationships, often called **"pig butchering" (Sha Zhu Pan)** where the scammer "fattens the pig before slaughter."

**Common scam types:**
- **Pig butchering scams** - Romance on dating apps evolving into crypto investment guidance
- **Trading "mentors"** - New online friends who share "winning" trading strategies
- **"Wrong number" friendship scams** - Accidentally texted contacts that develop into friendships then investments
- **Social media romance** - Instagram/Facebook relationships leading to investment opportunities

**Timeline:** These scams typically follow a pattern:
1. **Week 1-2:** Build trust and romance/friendship
2. **Week 3-4:** Casually mention crypto investing success
3. **Week 5-8:** Encourage small "test" investments that show profits
4. **Week 9+:** Pressure for larger deposits; eventually prevent withdrawals

**Red flag:** Someone you met online who gradually introduces crypto investing is a **major warning sign**.

### Rug Pulls & Fake Projects

**Description:** Projects that raise funds (via token sales, NFT mints, or presales) and then abandon the project or drain liquidity, leaving investors with worthless assets.

**Common scam types:**
- **Token rug pulls** - Developers remove liquidity or dump massive hidden allocations
- **NFT project abandonment** - Mint completes, then team disappears with no development
- **Fake ICO/IDO/presales** - Crowdfunding for projects that never launch
- **Honeypot contracts** - Tokens that can be bought but not sold due to contract code
- **Anonymous teams with locked socials** - Projects with no verifiable team suddenly vanish

**Due diligence checks:**
- Is the team doxxed and verifiable?
- Is liquidity locked or can it be pulled instantly?
- Does the contract have a mint function or ownership controls?
- Are there audit reports from reputable firms?
- Is there a real roadmap with demonstrated progress?

---

### Giveaway & Airdrop Frauds

**Description:** Fake giveaways or airdrops impersonating celebrities, influencers, or legitimate projects.

**Common scam types:**
- **Celebrity/influencer impersonation** - Fake verified accounts promising "double your crypto" giveaways
- **"Send-to-receive" scams** - "Send 0.1 ETH to receive 1 ETH" schemes
- **Fake project airdrops** - Phishing sites claiming you've won tokens if you connect your wallet
- **Twitter/X takeover giveaways** - Compromised accounts posting scam links

**Universal truth:** **No legitimate project will ever ask you to send crypto to receive more crypto.** Real airdrops either arrive automatically or require simple wallet verification (not sending funds).

---

### Recovery & Support Scams

**Description:** Scammers targeting victims who have already lost funds, claiming they can recover stolen assets for an upfront fee.

**Common scam types:**
- **Fake fund recovery services** - "We can retrieve your stolen crypto for $X,XXX upfront"
- **Impersonated customer support** - Fake support agents sliding into DMs after public complaints
- **"Hacker for hire" recovery** - Claims of insider connections or technical exploits to recover funds
- **Legal service scams** - Fake lawyers promising recovery through legal action

**Reality check:** Blockchain transactions are irreversible. Legitimate recovery efforts exist (blockchain forensics, law enforcement) but they:
- Never guarantee results
- Don't require large upfront payments
- Work through established firms, not random DMs
- Are transparent about the low likelihood of recovery

## Relatable Examples

> **The Romance Victim:** After matching on a dating app, they chatted for weeks. The romance felt real. Eventually, they mentioned investing in crypto and offered to teach. Small investments showed returns. Then larger deposits were encouraged. When withdrawal was attempted, the platform demanded "tax payment." **Total loss: $86,000.** The romantic partner disappeared.

### For Communities
- **Education campaigns** - Share common scam patterns in community channels
- **Verification badges** - Clear labeling of official team members vs. community

## What To Do If You've Been Scammed

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stop All Communication">
    Cut contact with the scammer immediately. Block them on all platforms. They may try to manipulate you further or target you for recovery scams.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Do NOT Send More Money">
    If a platform demands "taxes" or "fees" to withdraw, it's part of the scam. Do not send additional funds hoping to unlock your balance.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Document Everything">
    Save all messages, transaction hashes, wallet addresses, URLs, usernames, profiles, and emails. This is crucial for reports and investigations.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Report the Scam">
    - Your local police/cybercrime unit
    - FBI IC3: [ic3.gov](https://ic3.gov) (US victims)
    - FTC: [ReportFraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov)
    - ChainAbuse: Flag addresses and URLs
    - Platform where you met: Dating app, social media, etc.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Protect Against Recovery Scams">
    Be extremely wary of anyone promising to recover your funds. Legitimate recovery is rare, never guaranteed, and doesn't require large upfront payments.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Seek Support">
    Scam victims experience real trauma. Consider:
    - Talking to a counselor or therapist
    - Joining scam victim support communities
    - Connecting with financial advisors about recovery planning
  </Step>
</Steps>
