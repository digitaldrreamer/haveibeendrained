title: "Blackmail"
description: "Understanding threat-based extortion, sextortion, ransomware, and coercion tactics demanding crypto payments"
---

## Definition

**Pronunciation:** /ˈblæk.meɪl/ ("blak-mayl")

**Blackmail** is when someone threatens to reveal private, sensitive, or harmful information about you unless you pay them or do what they want. In crypto, blackmailers usually demand payment in cryptocurrency so that it is harder to trace them and because crypto payments are irreversible.

## What It Covers

This category includes attacks that:

- Demand crypto payments to stop release of intimate images or videos (sextortion)
- Encrypt your files or steal data, then ask for crypto to restore access (ransomware)
- Threaten to dox, harass, or physically harm someone unless payment is made
- Target businesses with threats to disrupt operations or damage reputation
- Use fear, shame, and urgency to force immediate crypto payments

## What It Does NOT Cover

- **Investment scams** where victims voluntarily send funds based on lies (see [Frauds](/safety-education/categories/frauds))
- **Password leaks** or account takeovers without an explicit threat for payment (see [Hacks](/safety-education/categories/hacks))
- General data breaches with no ransom or extortion demand

## Why It Matters

Blackmail attacks often hit people when they feel **most vulnerable, ashamed, or afraid**. Victims fear public exposure, business shutdown, or physical harm, and many pay quietly, which keeps the criminal business model alive.

**Key reality:** Law enforcement and cybersecurity experts often advise **not paying** blackmailers because:
- Payment doesn't guarantee the threat will stop
- It marks you as someone willing to pay, inviting repeat attacks
- It funds criminal operations that target more victims

Clear playbooks and support channels help people respond without panicking.

## Subcategories & Scam Types

### Sextortion & Intimate Image Blackmail

**Description:** Scams where someone threatens to share nude or sexual images or recordings unless the victim pays or obeys. Includes both real images obtained through hacking or relationship manipulation, and fake AI-generated or doctored content.

**Common scam types:**
- **Mass sextortion spam emails** - Bulk emails claiming to have webcam footage, demanding Bitcoin (usually fake)
- **One-to-one sextortion** - After sharing images in a relationship or on adult sites, attacker demands payment
- **Fake "hacked webcam" threats** - Generic claims with no proof, often using leaked passwords to seem credible
- **AI-generated deepfakes** - Threats using fake but convincing content

**Common pattern:** Scammer claims "I have videos of you watching adult content" or "I'll send these photos to your contacts" unless you pay within 24-48 hours.

**Critical insight:** Most mass sextortion emails are **completely fake**—the scammer has no actual content. Even when content is real, payment rarely stops the extortion.

---

### Ransomware & Data Extortion

**Description:** Attacks where malware encrypts your files or steals your data, and attackers demand cryptocurrency to restore access or avoid leaks.

**Common scam types:**
- **Crypto ransomware encrypting files** - Malware locks your documents, photos, and databases until you pay
- **Double extortion** - Encryption PLUS threat to leak stolen data publicly
- **Small-business ransomware** - Targeting companies that can't afford downtime
- **Supply chain attacks** - Compromising one vendor to attack multiple downstream businesses

**Payment mechanics:** Ransomware typically demands Bitcoin, Monero, or other crypto to a specific address, with instructions delivered via Tor-hidden sites.

**Business impact:** Companies face impossible choices—pay ransom or face operational shutdown, data loss, and regulatory penalties for breaches.

---

### Doxxing & Threat-Based Extortion

**Description:** Threats to reveal your identity, address, or private information; or to harass your family, customers, or employees unless you pay.

**Common scam types:**
- **Identity exposure threats** - "Pay or I'll post your address and family info online"
- **Reputation attacks** - Threats to spam false reviews, complaints, or allegations
- **Business extortion** - Threats against founders, executives, or brands to disrupt operations
- **Physical harm threats** - Claims of knowing victim's location with implied danger

**Online targeting:** Crypto users, especially those with public profiles or known holdings, are increasingly targeted for doxxing-based extortion.

## Relatable Examples

> **The Fake Webcam Sextortion:** Ada receives an email: "I installed malware on your device. I have video of you visiting adult sites. Pay $800 in Bitcoin to [address] within 48 hours or I send to all your contacts." The email includes an old password from a data breach to seem credible. **Reality:** The scammer has no video—it's a mass spam campaign sent to millions. Ada reports and ignores it.

> **The Ransomware Business Shutdown:** Kofi's small digital agency wakes up to encrypted files and a ransom note demanding $15,000 in Bitcoin. Client projects, proposals, and invoices are all locked. The attackers threaten to leak client data if he doesn't pay within 72 hours. **Outcome:** Kofi reports to police, restores from offline backups made the week before, and rebuilds systems. No payment made.

> **The Doxxing Threat:** A crypto founder receives Telegram messages: "I know where you live. Pay 5 ETH to [address] or I'll post your home address and family details on every forum." The attacker includes a partial address from public records to scare them. **Response:** Founder documents everything, reports to police and platform, increases physical security, and doesn't pay.

## Recommended Controls

### For Individuals
- **Never share intimate content** with people you don't fully trust in person, understanding it can still be misused
- **Keep secure offline backups** - Use encrypted external drives or cloud services with versioning, disconnected from daily systems
- **Strong privacy settings** - Limit what's publicly visible on social media about your location, family, and work
- **Know reporting channels** - Have contacts for local police, cybercrime units, and support hotlines saved

### For Businesses
- **Regular backup testing** - Verify you can actually restore from backups quickly
- **Network segmentation** - Prevent ransomware from spreading to all systems at once
- **Employee security training** - Most ransomware enters through phishing emails
- **Incident response plan** - Documented steps for ransomware, including who to call and what to preserve
- **Cyber insurance** - Consider coverage that includes ransomware response (but policies vary on paying ransoms)

### For Crypto Users & Public Figures
- **Operational security (OPSEC)** - Avoid linking your real identity to wallet addresses or holdings
- **Physical security awareness** - If you're a known crypto holder, consider security measures
- **Progressive disclosure** - Share less publicly about your exact location and daily routines
- **Legal consultation** - Know defamation, harassment, and extortion laws in your jurisdiction
