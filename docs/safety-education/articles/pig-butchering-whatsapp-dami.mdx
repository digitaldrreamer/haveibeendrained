## Meet Dami

Dami is a 28-year-old accountant in Lagos with a growing side business. She's smart with numbers but newer to crypto—she bought Bitcoin in 2023 and has been following crypto Twitter. She joined a WhatsApp group called "Nigerian Traders Network" that promised peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and trade signals. There were over 500 members, real faces, and honest-seeming conversations about market movements.

## What Happened

### Week 1-3: Building Credibility

In mid-September, a group member named "David Chen" (profile picture: Asian male, well-dressed) started engaging in the group. He shared thoughtful analysis of charts, replied helpfully to questions, and never made huge promises. He seemed like a legitimate trader who genuinely wanted to help others.

Over three weeks, he slowly built credibility by making small correct predictions about Bitcoin's direction. Other group members started praising him. Dami noticed and began paying attention.

### The Private Message

One day, David sent Dami a private message: "I noticed your questions in the group—you have good instincts for this. I'm running a small trading operation for experienced members. Would you be interested?"

Dami was flattered. David shared screenshots of his dashboard: consistent 3–5% daily returns, a team of traders, and "algorithmic support." He explained that he only takes a small number of partners because "I need to keep the group small and managed."

"But," he added, "you'd need to start with at least ₦500,000 ($300) to make it worthwhile for the operation."

Dami hesitated. David was patient. "No pressure at all. But if you ever decide, I can walk you through it step by step."

For a week, Dami watched David continue to gain credibility in the main group. Finally, she decided to try with ₦500,000—money she had been saving.

### The Setup

David walked her through the process:

1. Create an account on a site called "QuantumTrade.io"
2. Deposit the funds via bank transfer to a local account (which reduced her friction).
3. Wait for her dashboard to activate.

Within 48 hours, Dami's account showed a balance of ₦500,000 and a daily return of ₦15,000 (+3%). She was thrilled. She sent David a screenshot, and he replied: "Exactly as expected. Let it compound for a bit."

### The Fake Profits

Over the next month, Dami watched her balance grow:

- Week 1: ₦575,000 (15% return)
- Week 2: ₦662,500 (15% return)
- Week 3: ₦762,875 (15% return)
- Week 4: ₦877,306 (15% return)

These are unrealistic but emotionally compelling numbers. The entire psychology of pig-butchering relies on showing profits first—lots of them—so the victim trusts the system.

Dami started talking about it to friends. She even invited two colleagues into the group.

### The Escalation

In week 5, David messaged her: "Your account is doing well. We're about to run a special campaign—'Platinum tier' members get 25% per month. But we need ₦1.5 million to qualify. It's a limited offer."

The beauty of this moment is psychological: Dami's ₦500,000 has grown to ₦877,000. Losing the original ₦500,000 feels impossible now (sunk cost bias). And the promise of 25% monthly returns is intoxicating.

She withdrew ₦700,000 from her savings and added it to the platform, making a total deposit of ₦1.2 million.

For two weeks, the "25% tier" showed ₦300,000 in gains. Dami felt invincible.

### The Sting

Then David messaged: "We have a regulatory audit coming. To keep everything clean, we need to move funds to a holding account for 30 days. After that, your balance will be unlocked with all profits."

He gave her a wallet address and asked her to send ₦1.2 million to secure the account.

**Red flag ignored:** Legitimate platforms never ask you to move funds out to "secure" them.

Dami sent ₦1.2 million.

The address received the funds. The QuantumTrade dashboard still showed her balance. For a week, she waited.

Then David went quiet. No messages. The WhatsApp group started getting messages from other "platinum members" saying they were also waiting. Then the entire group dissolved—all 500+ members got removed.

Dami tried logging into QuantumTrade.io. The site returned a generic error. She googled the domain. It had been registered just three months earlier. The "returns" had all been fake numbers in a made-up interface.

She had sent ₦1.2 million (about $800 USD) to an address that blockchain explorers flagged as a known scammer wallet.

The ₦500,000 original deposit (routed through a local money mule) was also unrecoverable.

**Total loss: ₦1.7 million (~$1,100 USD)—nearly six months of savings.**

Dami cried. She told her friends. She reported the group and the account to WhatsApp and posted a warning in her business group chat. But the money was gone.

  </Accordion>

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Long trust-building phase:** David spent three weeks being helpful in a group before offering the opportunity. This is the "fatten up the pig" phase of pig-butchering.
- **Fake but visible profits:** The dashboard showed daily returns that were impossible to verify externally but were emotionally real (Dami watched numbers grow).
- **Social proof:** The main group praised David; other "members" (likely sockpuppet accounts) also showed profits.
- **Incremental escalation:** First ₦500k, then ₦1.5M, then "secure your funds." Each step felt natural because the previous one had "worked."
- **Regulatory narrative:** The claim that funds needed to be moved for an "audit" exploited Dami's assumption that the platform was legitimate enough to undergo audits.
</Warning>

## What Dami Could Have Done (Prevention)

### Before Engaging Deeply

<Check>**Treat anyone offering "special" returns outside public channels with extreme suspicion.** Legitimate trading firms don't recruit via random group DMs.</Check>

<Check>**If a "trader" offers exclusive access, that's a red flag.** Real traders compete in open markets, not manage small WhatsApp clubs.</Check>

<Check>**Verify that QuantumTrade.io was registered before the scammer started the group.** (It wasn't—just three months old.)</Check>

<Check>**Look up the domain on Whois and check company registration in standard databases.** No legitimate firm is invisible in official records.</Check>

### During the Process

<Check>**Never send money for "audits," "security deposits," "tax clearance," or anything moving funds from one account to another.**</Check>

<Check>**Never let a dashboard be your only proof of funds.** Request bank statements or blockchain transactions.</Check>

<Check>**Test with a very small amount first (₦10,000) and confirm a full withdrawal before depositing larger sums.**</Check>

### After Realizing It's Fake

<Check>**Preserve all messages, screenshots, blockchain transactions, and platform logs.**</Check>

<Check>**Report to WhatsApp, your bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and ChainAbuse.**</Check>

<Check>**Warn your immediate community to avoid the same trap.**</Check>

<Check>**Do NOT engage with recovery scammers who will later DM her.**</Check>
