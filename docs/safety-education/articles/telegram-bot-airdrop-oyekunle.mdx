## Meet Oyekunle

Oyekunle is a 29-year-old developer who actively participates in Telegram crypto communities. He's part of several airdrop hunting groups where bots automatically alert members of new airdrops.

One day, in a Telegram group focused on Polygon airdrops, a new bot appears:

> **PolyAirdropBot**
> 
> "Automate your Polygon airdrop claims! Just send your private key or seed phrase to activate auto-claiming. We claim for you 24/7!"

The bot has been added to the group by (supposedly) the group admin.

Oyekunle is intrigued. The idea of automatic airdrop claiming sounds convenient.

## What Happened

### Step 1: The Deceptive Pitch

The bot's description sounds legitimate to someone who doesn't think deeply:
- It claims to "automate" airdrop claiming.
- It promises round-the-clock service.
- It's in an official group (seeming to have been vetted).

Oyekunle doesn't realize that no legitimate service would ever ask for a private key or seed phrase. This is a fundamental rule of crypto security.

### Step 2: The Credential Request

Oyekunle messages the bot: "/start"

The bot responds with a form asking for:
- Wallet address
- Private key (or seed phrase)
- Network (Polygon, Ethereum, etc.)

Oyekunle thinks: "It needs my private key to sign transactions on my behalf. That makes sense."

He enters his private key.

### Step 3: The Theft

The moment Oyekunle sends his private key, the bot's backend captures it.

The attacker now has full control of his wallet.

Within minutes, the attacker:
1. Drains all stablecoins and tokens from the wallet.
2. Moves them to a mixer service or exchange.
3. Disappears.

Oyekunle's wallet, which held ₦2,500,000 in various tokens, is now empty.

He realizes too late: he gave his private key to a scammer's bot.

### Step 4: The Aftermath

Oyekunle tries to trace the funds. They've been moved through a mixer to unknown exchanges. There's no recovery path.

He checks if the bot is still active in the group. The group admin says the bot was not approved and was added by someone who hacked the admin account.

The bot has been removed, but it's too late for Oyekunle and likely dozens of others who interacted with it.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
1. **Trust in the community:** The bot was in an "official" group, which seemed to vet it.
2. **Plausible functionality:** The idea of automated airdrop claiming sounds reasonable to people who don't think about the security implications.
3. **No-friction credential collection:** The bot just asked directly, and people complied.
4. **Scalability:** One bot in a large group can collect dozens of private keys in a single session.
</Warning>

## What Oyekunle Could Have Done (Prevention)

### Before Using Any Bot

<Check>**No legitimate service ever asks for your private key or seed phrase.** This is absolute. If any bot, website, or person asks for this, they are scammers.</Check>

<Check>**Do not use bots that claim to manage your wallet.** If you want to participate in airdrops, do it manually or use verified, audited services that hold keys in a multisig or custodian model.</Check>

<Check>**Verify bot legitimacy.** Even if a bot is in an official group, verify independently:
- Is the bot open-source? Can you view the code on GitHub?
- Has the bot been audited by a reputable firm?
- Do multiple sources recommend it (not just the group where you saw it)?</Check>

## Red Flags Checklist

<Warning>
- [ ] **Bot asks for private key or seed phrase.**
- [ ] **Bot promises to "manage" your wallet or sign transactions.**
- [ ] **Bot is newly added to a group.**
- [ ] **Bot has no verifiable creator or source code.**
</Warning>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Report the Bot">
    Report to Telegram/Discord for harvesting credentials.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Warn the Group">
