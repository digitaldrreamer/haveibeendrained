## Meet Blessing

Blessing has strong security on her Binance account:
- Long, unique password.
- 2FA enabled (TOTP via Google Authenticator).
- Email verified.

One day, she gets a message on Telegram from someone claiming to be "Binance Support":

> "Hi, we noticed unusual activity on your account. For your security, we need to verify your identity. Can you confirm your current password?"

Blessing is suspicious (legitimate support never asks for passwords) and ignores the message.

A few days later, she gets a similar message from what appears to be an official Binance support account (with a Binance-looking profile picture and name like "BinanceSupport_Official").

This time, the message says:

> "Your account is locked due to multiple failed login attempts. Click here to unlock."

Blessing clicks and is taken to a login page. She enters her credentials out of concern.

The page then asks for her 2FA code (saying it's needed to "unlock the account").

She enters the 2FA code from her authenticator app.

## What Happened

### Step 1: The Phishing and 2FA Code Capture

The attacker has now captured:
- Blessing's password
- Her 2FA code (which is valid for 30 seconds)

### Step 2: The Rapid Takeover

The attacker immediately:
1. Goes to Binance's login page (the real one).
2. Enters Blessing's email and password.
3. When prompted for 2FA, enters the code she provided (it's still within the 30-second window).
4. Logs in successfully.
5. Disables 2FA.
6. Withdraws all funds.

By the time Blessing checks her account, it's empty.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Phishing site:** The fake login page looked legitimate and captured credentials.
- **2FA code timing:** The attacker used the 2FA code within its 30-second validity window.
- **Social engineering:** The "account locked" message created urgency and bypassed skepticism.
- **Fake support account:** The impersonated support account looked official.
</Warning>

## Red Flags Blessing Should Have Heeded

- [ ] **Unsolicited messages asking for credentials or 2FA codes.**
- [ ] **Legitimate support never asks for passwords or 2FA codes.**
- [ ] **"Account locked" urgency messages are common phishing tactics.**

</Warning>
