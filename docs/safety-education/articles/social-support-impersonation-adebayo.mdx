## Meet Adebayo

Adebayo is a 31-year-old day trader who actively uses Uniswap on Ethereum. One day, he's trying to swap tokens but the transaction keeps failing with a vague error message. He's frustrated.

He posts in a public Telegram crypto trading group:

> "Anyone having issues with Uniswap swaps failing? Getting error code 0x12345. Any solutions?"

Within 5 minutes, he receives a direct message on Telegram from an account called "Uniswap_Support":

> "Hey! We saw your message about Uniswap issues. I'm from the official Uniswap support team. Let me help you troubleshoot. What's the error you're seeing?"

The account has:
- A Uniswap logo as the profile picture
- "Official Support" in the bio
- A few hundred followers (making it seem established)

Adebayo thinks: "Great! Official support is helping me."

## What Happened

### Step 1: Building Rapport

The fake support account asks Adebayo detailed questions:
- "Which wallet are you using?"
- "Which tokens are you swapping?"
- "What's your wallet address?" (for technical investigation)

Adebayo provides all this information. The account seems genuinely helpful—it's asking exactly the questions a real support person would ask.

### Step 2: The Solution Offer

The fake account says:

> "I see the issue. There's a bug in the router contract that's affecting your wallet. The fix requires you to approve a new contract that will route your transactions correctly. It's a one-time approval."

They send a link to what they claim is an official Uniswap fix site.

The URL looks legitimate: `uniswap-fix.io` (a fake domain, but with the Uniswap name).

Adebayo clicks the link. A professional-looking page explains the "router fix" and asks him to connect his wallet.

He connects.

### Step 3: The Approval

The page requests an approval to "enable the new router contract."

The MetaMask popup shows:

> "Approve [contract address] to spend your tokens?"

Adebayo approves, thinking he's fixing the issue.

### Step 4: The Drain

Within seconds, the "fix" site goes offline.

His wallet starts draining. The approval he granted was not for a legitimate fix but for a malicious contract that now has access to all his tokens.

Adebayo lost ₦800,000 in the drain.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Referencing a real problem:** Adebayo was frustrated and posted publicly. The scammer exploited that genuine issue.
- **Authority impersonation:** A fake "official support" account seemed credible.
- **Plausible solution:** A contract fix sounded like a real technical solution.
- **Isolation from community:** Moving to DM isolated Adebayo from others who might have warned him.
</Warning>

## Red Flags Adebayo Missed

<Warning>
- [ ] **Official support never DMs first.** Legitimate support teams respond in public channels or via verified official accounts.
- [ ] **The account age and followers weren't verified.** Adebayo didn't check if the account was officially recognized.
- [ ] **The "fix" required an approval.** Real bug fixes would be deployed on the official platform, not requiring user approvals.
- [ ] **The domain was new and unverified.** `uniswap-fix.io` is not an official Uniswap domain.
</Warning>
