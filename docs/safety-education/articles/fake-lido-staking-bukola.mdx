## Meet Bukola

Bukola has ₦5 million in ETH and wants to stake it to earn rewards. She sees an ad on Google for "Lido Staking – Earn 3.5% on your ETH":

**Link:** `lido-staking-easy.com`

She clicks and lands on a professional-looking page that explains Lido staking and asks her to "deposit ETH to stake."

She deposits ₦5 million worth of ETH.

She's asked to approve a "staking contract" to process the deposit.

She approves.

The contract drains all her ETH.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Google ad spoofing:** The ad appeared in search results, making it seem legitimate.
- **Domain typosquatting:** `lido-staking-easy.com` vs. real `lido.fi`.
- **Staking approval:** The approval request seemed normal for staking operations.
- **Professional design:** The site looked official and trustworthy.
</Warning>

## Red Flags Bukola Missed

<Warning>
- [ ] **Official Lido domain is `lido.fi`, not `lido-staking-easy.com`.**
- [ ] **Google ads can be spoofed.** Attackers bid on ads for legitimate protocols and link to fakes.
- [ ] **Contract address wasn't verified** before approval.
- [ ] **No official verification** from Lido's official channels.
</Warning>
