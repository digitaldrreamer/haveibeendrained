## Meet Blessing

Blessing is a 22-year-old final-year university student in Abuja. She follows several crypto Twitter/Instagram creators, including a popular figure called "CryptoKing Jide" with 200,000 followers.

One day, Jide posts:

> "Just discovered DogeMoonFloki 🚀. The chart just broke out. This could be the next 100x. Position size: 2 ETH. Watching closely. #HODL"

He includes a screenshot showing a recent portfolio update with DogeMoonFloki added.

Blessing is a fan of Jide. He seems knowledgeable, and he's been right before (or at least, she believes he has). She looks up DogeMoonFloki.

The chart shows a recent run-up. The Twitter account has 50,000 followers. The community is hyped.

Blessing buys ₦50,000 worth.

## What Happened

### Phase 1: The Shill

Over the next 4 days, Jide posts about DogeMoonFloki every day:

> "DogeMoonFloki consolidating. This is healthy. Big breakout soon. 🚀"

> "Team just announced partnership with [fake exchange]. Massive catalyst incoming."

> "I added 2 more ETH. This is my highest conviction play this month."

His posts reach 5,000–10,000 likes each. His followers start buying. The price climbs from ₦0.0005 to ₦0.001 to ₦0.005.

Blessing's ₦50,000 is now worth ₦500,000.

Other influencers (smaller accounts) start shilling too:

> "DogeMoonFloki is going to ₦0.1. This is a gem. 💎"

> "Jide is in this. That's enough for me. 🚀🚀🚀"

Blessing feels validated. Even small influencers are talking about it.

### Phase 2: The Peak

On Day 5, the price hits ₦0.01. Market cap is now ₦100+ billion.

The chart looks parabolic. Everyone who bought is up huge.

Blessing sees posts celebrating:

> "Just 10xed my investment! Thank you @CryptoKingJide for the call! 🙏"

> "To the moon! 🚀🌙"

### Phase 3: The Dump

On Day 6, something changes.

Jide hasn't posted in 12 hours. That's unusual—he posts 5–6 times daily.

Then, suddenly, a massive sell order hits the DEX. The price crashes from ₦0.01 to ₦0.0002 in 30 minutes.

Blessing panic-sells and only gets ₦30,000 out, losing ₦20,000.

She checks BscScan.

The large sellers' wallets match the "influencer" accounts that were shilling. Reverse-image searching the influencers' profile photos reveals they're all using stock photos or stolen images.

There is no "CryptoKing Jide." It was a coordinated network of bot accounts and paid shillers, all controlled by the DogeMoonFloki creators.

The "partnership" was fabricated. The "team" doesn't exist. It was pump-and-dump from the start.

Blessing was manipulated by fake influencers into buying at the peak so the creators could dump on her.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Fake influencer authority:** The accounts looked credible, had followers, and seemed knowledgeable.
- **Coordination:** Multiple "influencers" amplified the same message, creating the illusion of consensus.
- **FOMO:** The rapid price action and hype made Blessing feel like she was missing out if she didn't buy.
- **Perfectly timed posts:** Each post came at the right moment to keep the hype alive and push more retail in.
</Warning>

## What Blessing Could Have Done (Prevention)

### Red Flags to Watch

<Check>**Influencer timing:** If an influencer suddenly shills a token hard for a few days, then goes quiet while the price crashes, assume they were paid or complicit.</Check>

<Check>**Profile verification:** Verify that influencers are real by: Checking their account age (new accounts = red flag).</Check>
<Check>**Profile verification:** Verify that influencers are real by: Reverse-image-searching their profile photo.</Check>

<Check>**On-chain analysis:** Check if the influencer's claimed holdings are real. If they post a screenshot of their portfolio, verify it on-chain.</Check>

<Check>**Coordinated shilling:** If multiple "influencers" are posting about a token at the same time, assume it's coordinated.</Check>

### Safe Behavior

<Check>**Distrust influencer calls.** Even if an influencer seems legitimate, assume they are either: Paid to shill by the project (common).</Check>
<Check>**Distrust influencer calls.** Even if an influencer seems legitimate, assume they are either: Exiting their own positions while encouraging others to buy.</Check>

<Check>**Do your own research.** Don't buy because someone with followers told you to.</Check>

<Check>**Exit when the shill stops.** If an influencer suddenly goes quiet about a token they were hyping, that's your signal to exit.</Check>
