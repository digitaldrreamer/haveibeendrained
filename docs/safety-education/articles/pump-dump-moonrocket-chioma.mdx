## Meet Chioma

Chioma is a 25-year-old trader and Discord regular. She's active in crypto trading communities and likes researching new tokens early. She stumbles on a Discord server called "MoonRocket Alphas" with 10,000 members.

The pitch: a project called MoonRocket token with:
- Focus on remittances in Africa
- Real-world utility (planned wallet)
- Supply cap (deflationary)
- No presale (fair launch)

The founder is visible in the Discord, answering questions daily. The community vibe is enthusiastic but not aggressive. Chioma feels like she found a diamond early.

She buys ₦200,000 worth at launch price of ₦0.0001 per token.

## What Happened

### Week 1: Excitement

The token launches on a small DEX. Price climbs steadily to ₦0.0005 (5x).

The Discord celebrates. Chioma feels smart.

The founder posts daily:
- "We're onboarding the first partner wallet."
- "First remittance corridor live next month."
- "Wallet beta testing next week."

### Week 2–4: Growth & "Organic" Momentum

The price climbs to ₦0.002.

Chioma's ₦200,000 is now worth ₦4,000,000.

The community continues to hype. New members join daily. The feeling is "we're building something real."

But behind the scenes, something is happening.

The founder created a private Telegram group called "Core Team + Early Believers" (about 200 members). Chioma was invited.

In that group, the tone is different.

The founder posts:

> "Guys, we've hit our growth target. Time to execute exit strategy. Tomorrow at 3 PM UTC, we coordinate the sell."

Chioma's stomach drops.

But then she reads the next message:

> "Early believers stay in. We're dumping our founder tokens and early investor bags. Don't sell yet. After we exit and price crashes, it will pump again. This is normal."

Chioma is torn. She believed in the project. But she also understands: the founders are about to dump on the community.

The "private group" is a tool to separate insiders from retail.

### The Exit

At 3 PM UTC the next day, a massive sell order hits the DEX. The price crashes from ₦0.002 to ₦0.0001 in minutes.

Chioma and other retail holders panic-sell, taking losses.

The founders' tokens are converted to USDT and moved to exchanges to cash out.

The price recovers slightly over a few days (maybe to ₦0.00015), but it never returns to ₦0.002.

Chioma held and lost most of her gains.

The Discord community explodes with accusations. The founder briefly appears and says:

> "Volatility is part of crypto. HODL and we will moon."

But the promised "wallet beta" never comes. The "remittance partner" is never named. The project goes quiet.

Chioma realizes it was a pump-and-dump: the founders pumped excitement, waited for retail to buy, then coordinated an exit, dumping their bags on retail while staying profitable themselves.

This is distinct from a hard rug pull (where all liquidity is drained instantly). It's a softer, but equally devastating, scam: insiders sell on retail, then the project withers.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Trust through transparency:** The founder was visible, answered questions, and seemed engaged. This is disarming.
- **VIP insider group:** Separating "believers" from retail created two tiers of information.
- **Coordinated exit:** Dumping together, and timing the sell for maximum impact, ensured insiders got out at good prices.
- **Vague roadmap:** No specific milestones meant no accountability.
</Warning>

---

## What Chioma Could Have Done (Prevention)

<Check>**Red flag: "VIP early believers" private group.** Legitimate projects do not separate communities by insider status.</Check>

<Check>**Never trust promises.** "Wallet beta," "partnerships," and "integration" are easy to claim and hard to verify. If they are not live and auditable, assume they don't exist.</Check>

<Check>**Watch for large holder activity:** Use blockchain explorers to watch how many tokens the founder/early team hold and when they sell.</Check>

<Check>**If insiders are selling, that's a signal to exit.** Founders who believe in their project do not coordinate large sells.</Check>

---

## Red Flags Checklist

<Warning>
- [ ] **"Private group" for "early believers" or "insiders."**
- [ ] **Promises of future utilities with no live demo.**
- [ ] **Large founder/team wallets visible on-chain** (check holder distribution on BscScan/EtherScan).
- [ ] **Sudden large sell orders into the pump.**
- [ ] **Founder activity drops after the spike.**
</Warning>

## How Pump-and-Dump Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Phase 1: Accumulation" icon="arrow-down">
**What happens:** Creators and insiders quietly accumulate tokens cheaply at launch or before public announcement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Phase 2: Hype Building" icon="megaphone">
**What happens:** Team builds community, makes promises, creates excitement. Price climbs as retail buys in.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Phase 3: Insider Coordination" icon="users">
**What happens:** Insiders create private groups to coordinate exit timing. They separate themselves from retail.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Phase 4: Coordinated Exit" icon="arrow-up">
**What happens:** At predetermined time, all insiders dump simultaneously. Price crashes as large sell orders hit.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Phase 5: Project Abandonment" icon="ghost">
**What happens:** After exit, project goes quiet. Promised utilities never materialize. Community fades.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Action Steps

### Prevention

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Holder Distribution" icon="chart-pie">
**Check:** On BscScan/EtherScan, check the token's top 20 holders. If one wallet is > 30%, and it's the creator, that's a dump risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Watch Founder Wallets" icon="eye">
**Track:** Track the founder's wallet for sales. If they start exiting, assume the project is over.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Suspect Coordinated Exits" icon="users-slash">
**Rule:** If a Discord/Telegram group is divided into "insiders" and retail, assume insiders will exit first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Exit at Your Target Price" icon="target">
**Rule:** Exit at your target price, not the community's. FOMO into "to the moon" narratives is how you get dumped on.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### If You're Already Involved

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor On-Chain Activity">
    Watch founder and large holder wallets for sell activity.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Exit When Insiders Exit">
    If you see coordinated large sells, exit immediately.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Don't Hold Hoping for Recovery">
    Pump-and-dumps rarely recover. Take your losses and move on.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Report the Project">
    Report to ChainAbuse and warn others in the community.
  </Step>
</Steps>
