## Meet Kemi

Kemi is a 26-year-old HR manager who follows crypto Twitter and wants to grow her ₦800,000 emergency fund. Her cousin mentioned a "CryptoWealth Circle" that promised consistent 10% monthly returns.

She joined a Telegram group with 3,000 members.

## What Happened

### The Structure

The group had a clear structure:

- **Entry-level:** Deposit ₦100,000 → get 10% monthly returns (₦10,000).
- **Silver:** Deposit ₦500,000 → get 12% monthly (₦60,000).
- **Gold:** Deposit ₦1,000,000 → get 15% monthly (₦150,000).
- **Platinum:** Deposit ₦5,000,000 → get 20% monthly (₦1,000,000).

There was also a referral system: bring three friends and get an extra 2% bonus on their deposits.

"Too good to be true" warning bells should have rung immediately, but Kemi saw dozens of "success stories" in the Telegram group—people posting screenshots of their "growth."

She deposited ₦500,000 as a Silver member.

### Months 1-3: The Illusion

For the first three months, she received ₦60,000 monthly like clockwork. She withdrew ₦50,000 once and it went through (a classic scam tactic—small withdrawals go through to build confidence).

### Months 4-6: Recruiting Others

Months 4–6: She referred three friends, each depositing ₦500,000. She got her 2% bonus (₦30,000 total). Her friends also started receiving their "returns."

### Months 7-9: Escalation

Months 7–9: New members were required. The admin (only known as "CEO Zainab") pushed a new tier: "Diamond" (₦10,000,000 at 25% monthly). Kemi didn't join but urged her friends to.

### Month 10: The Warning Signs

Month 10: The daily deposits into the scheme dropped. New signups slowed. The admin said this was "temporary market adjustment" and promised returns would "resume soon."

### Month 11: The Collapse

Month 11: The Telegram group went silent. Messages to the admin got no response. The group was deleted.

Kemi checked her balance: still ₦500,000, but she couldn't log in to "withdraw."

She reached out to her three referrals. All reported the same issue.

**Total loss: ₦500,000 + the guilt of having invited three friends who each lost ₦500,000.**

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **MLM Structure:** Early payouts came from new deposits (Ponzi mechanics), not from actual trading.
- **Social proof:** Fake testimonials and real early withdrawals convinced people it was legitimate.
- **Referral incentive:** Victims became recruiters, expanding the scheme exponentially.
- **"Guaranteed" language:** The promise of fixed percentages, regardless of market conditions, is mathematically unsustainable.
</Warning>

## Red Flags (What Kemi Missed)

<Warning>
- [ ] **10–25% monthly returns = 120–300% annually.** No real investment strategy produces this.
- [ ] **No clear investment strategy explained**—"AI," "trading bot," vague marketing.
- [ ] **Admin is anonymous or untraceable.**
- [ ] **Structure rewards recruitment more than actual trading.**
- [ ] **No third-party custodian or audit.**
</Warning>

## How MLM/Ponzi Schemes Work

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The Mathematics" icon="calculator">
**Reality:** For a scheme to pay 10% monthly to 1,000 members with ₦500,000 each, it needs ₦50 million in new deposits every month just to cover returns. This is mathematically impossible to sustain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Early Payouts" icon="banknote">
**Tactic:** Early members receive payouts from new deposits, creating the illusion of legitimacy. This works until new deposits slow down.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recruitment Pressure" icon="users">
**Tactic:** The scheme relies on constant recruitment. When recruitment slows, the scheme collapses.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The Collapse" icon="building-2">
**Inevitable:** All Ponzi schemes collapse when new deposits can't cover promised returns. The operators disappear with remaining funds.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Action Steps

### Prevention

<Check>**Assume "guaranteed" returns are scams.** Legitimate investments have risk and variability.</Check>

<Check>**Do not join schemes based primarily on recruitment.**</Check>

<Check>**Verify the investment thesis.** Ask: "What are they actually trading/investing in?" If the answer is vague, it's a scam.</Check>

<Check>**Report to FIRS and SEC** if a pyramid/Ponzi scheme is operating in Nigeria.</Check>
