## Meet Ngozi

Ngozi uses Chrome and frequently trades on DEXs. She sees an ad for "Gas Fee Optimizer" — an extension that supposedly reduces Ethereum gas fees.

She installs it from the Chrome Web Store.

The extension works for a few days, seeming to help with gas optimization.

Then, one day, her MetaMask is drained.

## What Happened

### Step 1: The Malicious Extension

The "Gas Fee Optimizer" was a malicious extension that requested broad permissions:
- "Access your data on all websites"
- "Modify data you send to websites"
- "Read your browser history"

Ngozi approved these permissions without reading them carefully (most users do).

### Step 2: The Wallet Compromise

The extension, with its broad permissions, could:
- Intercept MetaMask transactions.
- Modify transaction data before sending.
- Capture wallet data and seed phrases (if displayed).
- Redirect wallet interactions to malicious sites.

### Step 3: The Theft

The extension redirected Ngozi's MetaMask requests to a fake wallet interface controlled by the attacker.

When Ngozi logged into MetaMask, she was actually logging into a phishing site created by the extension.

Her credentials were captured, and the attacker drained her wallet.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Broad permissions:** The extension requested access to all websites, allowing it to intercept any data.
- **Legitimate-sounding purpose:** "Gas Fee Optimizer" seemed useful and legitimate.
- **Chrome Web Store listing:** Being on the official store made it seem trustworthy.
- **Silent operation:** The extension worked normally while secretly intercepting data.
</Warning>

## Red Flags Ngozi Missed

<Warning>
- [ ] **Extensions asking for broad permissions** ("Access all websites," "Modify data").
- [ ] **Extensions from unknown developers.**
- [ ] **Recent extensions** (newly published or updated).
- [ ] **Too many permissions for stated purpose:** A gas optimizer shouldn't need access to all websites.
</Warning>

## Prevention

<Check>**Only install extensions from trusted sources** (major companies, GitHub projects with community backing).</Check>

<Check>**Review permissions carefully.** If an extension asks for "access to all websites," question why it needs that.</Check>

<Check>**Limit wallet access.** Don't use MetaMask on untrusted networks or with suspicious extensions.</Check>

<Check>**Audit extensions regularly.** Remove any you don't actively use.</Check>

<Check>**Check extension reviews:** Look for warnings about data theft or suspicious behavior.</Check>
