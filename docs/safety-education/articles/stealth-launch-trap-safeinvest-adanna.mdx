## Meet Adanna

Adanna is a 24-year-old university student interested in crypto. She follows several Telegram channels that share "early" token launches. One channel called "CryptoGems Hunters" posts:

> "SafeInvest token — stealth launching NOW on PancakeSwap. No presale, fair launch. Locked liquidity. Real team. Get in early!"

A "stealth launch" usually means a token launched without pre-announcement, allowing early insiders to accumulate cheaply before hype drives the price up.

Adanna thinks: "This could be the one."

She sends ₦100,000 to the DEX address provided and receives SafeInvest tokens.

## What Happened

### Hour 1: The Rush

The token appears on PancakeSwap. Price is still cheap: ₦0.00001 per token. Adanna has 10 billion tokens for her ₦100,000.

She watches as other people buy. The chart shows tiny green candles. Volume is low but active.

The price starts climbing: ₦0.00002, then ₦0.00005, then ₦0.0001.

Adanna's position is up 10x in 30 minutes.

### Hour 2–6: Hype Builds

The "CryptoGems Hunters" channel explodes with messages:

> "SafeInvest mooning!"
> "₦0.001 incoming"
> "HODL 💎🚀"

More people buy. Volume increases. The chart looks healthy.

Adanna sees her position worth ₦1,000,000.

She considers selling but holds—everyone is saying it's just getting started.

### Hour 7: The Cliff

Suddenly, the price drops 80% in seconds.

Adanna panics and tries to sell. The slippage is insane (50%+), and she only gets ₦150,000 out, netting a ₦50,000 loss.

She checks on-chain.

A massive wallet (holding 40% of the token supply) just moved their tokens to a DEX and sold them all in one transaction.

That wallet was identified as the "team" or "founder" wallet when the contract was created.

Adanna digs deeper.

She uses BscScan to check the token's creation block. She discovers:

1. **The contract was created 1 hour before the "stealth launch."** This means the creator minted tokens for themselves instantly upon deployment.

2. **The creator wallet received 40% of all tokens.** The remaining 60% went to the liquidity pool.

3. **The "locked liquidity" was never locked.** The creator was just waiting for price to climb before extracting value.

Adanna realizes: a "stealth launch" in this context was just a token created by one person, with them giving themselves a 40% pre-mine. They waited for retail to pump the price, then dumped their pre-mined bag on retail.

This is called a **stealth launch rug pull**: the creator mines tokens for themselves before launch, waits for hype to pump the price, then exits with huge gains while retail losses pile up.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Pre-mine:** 40% of tokens created at deploy, given to creator.
- **Stealth timing:** No pre-announcement means the creator gets in first, before anyone else.
- **No lock:** "Locked liquidity" was a false claim; the creator had full control and timing.
- **Hype channel:** Using Telegram "gem hunter" groups to flood new buyers with urgency.
</Warning>

---

## What Adanna Could Have Done (Prevention)

### Before Buying

<Check>**Check contract creation:** On BscScan, look at the token's creation block. Check:
- When was it created (less than 1 day old is risky)?
- What was the first transaction (did the creator mint a large % of tokens)?
- Is the creator's wallet visible on the holders list?</Check>

<Check>**Check holder distribution:** On BscScan, view "Token Holders." If one wallet holds > 20% (other than the liquidity pool), assume it's a dump risk.</Check>

<Check>**Verify "locked liquidity":** Even if they claim liquidity is locked, verify on Pinksale, Unicrypt, or the contract. A claim without proof is worthless.</Check>

<Check>**Be skeptical of "stealth launches."** The mechanics are designed to benefit insiders over retail. Real projects announce launches publicly and give everyone equal access.</Check>

### If You Bought Anyway

<Check>**Exit on the first major dump.** If price drops > 20% in one candle, don't hold hoping for recovery. Get out.</Check>

<Check>**Track large wallet movements.** If the creator's wallet shows massive sells, that's your signal to exit immediately.</Check>

## Red Flags Checklist

<Warning>
- [ ] **Token created < 1 day ago.**
- [ ] **One wallet holds > 20% of supply.**
- [ ] **"Stealth launch" = insiders got in before public announcement.**
- [ ] **Locked liquidity claimed but not verifiable on-chain.**
- [ ] **Large sudden sell orders from early wallets.**
- [ ] **Hype comes from Telegram "gem hunter" channels, not official announcements.**
</Warning>

## How Stealth Launch Rug Pulls Work

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Pre-Mine" icon="coins">
**What happens:** Creator deploys contract and mints large percentage of tokens to their own wallet before public launch.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Stealth Launch" icon="rocket">
**What happens:** Token is launched without pre-announcement. Creator and insiders buy first at lowest price.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 3: Hype Phase" icon="megaphone">
**What happens:** Telegram channels and social media hype the token. Retail buyers flood in, driving price up.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 4: Dump" icon="arrow-down">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 5: Collapse" icon="trending-down">
**What happens:** Price crashes 80-99%. Retail holders cannot exit due to low liquidity and high slippage.

## Action Steps

### Prevention

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check Contract Age" icon="clock">
**Rule:** If token is less than 1 day old, be extremely cautious. Check creation block and first transactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verify Holder Distribution" icon="chart-pie">
**Check:** Use BscScan/EtherScan to view top holders. If creator holds > 20%, it's a dump risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Avoid Stealth Launches" icon="ban">
**Rule:** Stealth launches are designed to benefit insiders. Prefer projects with public, fair launches.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Stop-Loss" icon="target">
**Rule:** If you do buy, set a stop-loss. Exit immediately if price drops > 20% in one candle.
  </Accordion>

### If You're Already Involved

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check On-Chain Immediately">
    Verify contract age, holder distribution, and creator wallet activity.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Exit on First Major Dump">
    If price drops > 20% suddenly, exit immediately. Don't hold hoping for recovery.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Creator Wallet">
    Track the creator's wallet for sell activity. If they're selling, exit.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Report the Token">
    Report to ChainAbuse and warn others in Telegram channels.
