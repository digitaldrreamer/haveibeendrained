## Meet Tunde

Tunde is a 27-year-old trader who uses MetaMask regularly. One evening, he receives an email:

**Subject:** "URGENT: Verify Your MetaMask Account – Unusual Activity Detected"

The email:
- Uses MetaMask's logo
- Claims unusual activity was detected on his account
- Says he needs to verify his account immediately
- Includes a link: `https://metamask-verify.io/confirm-identity`

Tunde is alarmed. He clicks the link.

## What Happened

He lands on a page that looks identical to MetaMask's official site. It asks him to "verify" by entering his seed phrase or password.

Tunde enters his seed phrase.

The page processes and then displays: "Verification complete. Your account is secure."

But it wasn't verification. The attacker captured his seed phrase.

Within minutes, the attacker imports his seed into a new MetaMask instance and drains his wallet (which had ₦1.2M in various tokens).

Tunde's wallet is empty before he realizes what happened.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Email urgency:** "URGENT" and "Unusual Activity" created fear and bypassed critical thinking.
- **Perfect UI cloning:** The fake site looked identical to MetaMask's official site.
- **Fake domain:** `metamask-verify.io` looked legitimate but was not an official MetaMask domain.
- **Authority:** Using MetaMask's logo and branding made it seem official.
</Warning>

## Red Flags Tunde Missed

<Warning>
- [ ] **Official MetaMask never emails about account verification.**
- [ ] **No wallet ever asks for your seed phrase via email or website.**
- [ ] **The domain is fake:** `metamask-verify.io` instead of `metamask.io`.
- [ ] **Email sender domain doesn't match:** Check if it's actually from MetaMask.
</Warning>
