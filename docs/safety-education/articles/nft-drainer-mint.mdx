## Meet Bola

Bola is a 26-year-old graphic designer and NFT collector from Port Harcourt. He's been collecting NFTs for over a year, owns pieces from several established projects, and actively participates in Discord communities to discover new artists and drops.

His wallet holds about $12,000 worth of NFTs plus 2.5 ETH (~$8,000) reserved for future mints. He's security-conscious—uses a hardware wallet for long-term holdings and a MetaMask wallet for active minting and trading.

## What Happened

### Week 1: The Discord Invite

Bola was browsing Twitter when he saw a thread about an upcoming NFT project: "CyberPunks Reborn" - described as a "spiritual successor to CryptoPunks with modern art and utility."

The thread showed impressive artwork, a roadmap with DAO governance and metaverse integration, and testimonials from "early whitelisted members." The project had 15,000 Twitter followers and an active Discord with 8,500 members.

Bola clicked the Discord invite link in the Twitter bio and joined the server.

The Discord looked legitimate:
- Organized channels (announcements, whitelist, general chat, art showcase)
- Active conversations (dozens of messages per hour)
- Verified bot showing mint countdown
- "Team" members with colored roles
- Partnerships with other NFT projects

Bola filled out the whitelist form (name, Twitter handle, wallet address, why he wanted to join). Two days later, he received a DM:

> *"🎉 Congratulations @Bola! You've been whitelisted for CyberPunks Reborn. Mint goes live in 48 hours. Whitelist mint: 0.08 ETH. Public: 0.15 ETH. Get ready!"*

### Day of Mint: The Announcement

On mint day, the announcement channel exploded with excitement. The team posted:

> *"🚀 MINT IS LIVE! Whitelist members click here: [link]  
> ⏰ Whitelist window: 2 hours  
> 💎 Price: 0.08 ETH  
> 🔥 10,000 supply - don't miss out!*"

Bola clicked the link. It took him to `cyberpunksreborn.art/mint`

The site looked polished:
- Clean design matching the Discord branding
- Live mint counter showing "3,287 / 10,000 minted"
- Gallery of the NFT artwork
- "Connect Wallet" button

He connected his MetaMask. A popup showed: *"Sign message to verify whitelist status"*

He signed. The site confirmed: *"✅ Whitelist verified! You can mint up to 3 NFTs."*

### The Malicious Mint

Bola selected "Mint 2" and clicked confirm. Total: 0.16 ETH.

A MetaMask popup appeared, but instead of a simple ETH transfer, it showed a contract interaction with dense technical details.

**Red flag #1:** The contract address didn't match the one shown on the website's "Contract" page.

But Bola was in a rush—the mint was selling out fast according to the counter. He clicked "Confirm."

Within seconds, his wallet started sending transactions he didn't authorize:

**Transaction 1:** Transfer NFT "Bored Ape #4521" → 0x9f8e...bc43  
**Transaction 2:** Transfer NFT "Doodle #892" → 0x9f8e...bc43  
**Transaction 3:** Transfer 2.5 ETH → 0x9f8e...bc43  
**Transaction 4-8:** Transfer USDC, USDT, and other tokens → 0x9f8e...bc43

Before Bola could react, **his entire wallet was empty.**

The "mint" page displayed a generic error: *"Transaction failed. Please try again."*

### The Aftermath

Panicking, Bola checked Etherscan. The address he "minted" from (0x9f8e...bc43) was flagged as **"NFT Drainer - Reported 1,247 times."**

He rushed back to Discord—**the entire server had vanished.** Deleted.

He checked Twitter—the @CyberPunksReborn account was **gone.**

The website `cyberpunksreborn.art` showed **"Domain not found."**

He searched for "CyberPunks Reborn scam" and found dozens of tweets from other victims who lost funds in the exact same way, all posted within the past hour.

**Total loss:**
- 12 valuable NFTs worth ~$10,000
- 2.5 ETH (~$8,000)
- Various tokens (~$2,000)
- **Total: ~$20,000**

## Where the Scammer Won

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Fake Community Building" icon="users">
**What Bola saw:** 8,500-member Discord, active chats, partnerships, testimonials

**The reality:** Most members were bots. "Active" conversations were scripted or from sock puppet accounts. The partnerships were fake (other scam projects or impersonation).

**The tactic:** Build social proof at scale. Large membership + activity = perceived legitimacy. Many victims said they joined "because so many others already had."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Time Pressure & FOMO" icon="clock">
**The sequence:**
- Whitelist forms (creates commitment)
- Countdown timers (creates urgency)
- Live mint counter (creates scarcity fear)
- "Selling out fast!" messages (triggers panic buying)

**Why it works:** Under time pressure, people skip security checks. Bola noticed the contract mismatch but clicked anyway to "not miss out."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. The Malicious &quot;SetApprovalForAll&quot;" icon="file-contract">
**What Bola thought he signed:** Mint transaction for 0.16 ETH

**What he actually signed:** `setApprovalForAll` granting the drainer contract permission to transfer ALL his NFTs and tokens

**How drainers hide it:**
- Popup happens fast during high-pressure mint moment
- Technical details in hex format look normal to inexperienced users
- Legitimate mints ALSO use contract interactions, so it doesn't seem unusual

**The execution:** Once approved, the backend script automatically called `transferFrom` for every valuable asset.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. The Quick Disappearance" icon="ghost">
**Timeline:** Discord/Twitter/Website all deleted within 30 minutes of mint going live

**Why:** Scammers know victims will try to warn others. By disappearing immediately, they:
- Prevent warnings from spreading
- Make evidence harder to gather
- Move to the next fake project quickly

**Scale:** Same scam operation likely runs dozens of fake projects simultaneously.

## Red Flags Bola Missed

<Warning>
- [ ] **Contract address mismatch** - Site showed one address, MetaMask showed different one
- [ ] **New project with huge following** - 8,500 Discord members for a project that launched 2 weeks ago
- [ ] **Anonymous team** - No real names, no verifiable track records
- [ ] **Rushed whitelist process** - Form → whitelist → mint in under 72 hours
- [ ] **Generic website domain** - `.art` TLD instead of established `.com` or `.io`
- [ ] **No smart contract audit** - Claimed to be audited but no report link
- [ ] **Too-good-to-be-true roadmap** - Every trendy feature (DAO, metaverse, P2E, staking) promised
- [ ] **SetApprovalForAll request** - This permission is dangerous; mints should be simple ETH transfers
</Warning>

## How NFT Drainer Scams Work

### Step 1: Infrastructure Setup (24-48 hours)
- Register domain (cheap, $10-$50/year)
- Clone templates from real NFT projects
- Deploy malicious smart contract to blockchain
- Set up Discord server with bot population
- Create Twitter account, buy followers (~$500 for 15K followers)

### Step 2: Social Engineering (1-2 weeks)
- Post impressive (stolen) artwork
- Build fake whitelist hype
- Partner with other scam projects for cross-promotion
- Use bots to simulate active community
- Run fake "alpha" channels offering "insider info"

### Step 3: The Drainer Contract
```solidity
// Simplified example - real drainers are more sophisticated
function mint(uint256 quantity) external payable {
    // Looks like a normal mint function
    require(msg.value >= price * quantity, "Insufficient payment");
    
    // But when called, it requests setApprovalForAll
    // This grants permission to transfer ALL victim's NFTs/tokens
}

function drain(address victim) external onlyOwner {
    // After victim approves, owner can drain everything
    IERC721(valuableNFT).transferFrom(victim, attacker, tokenId);
    IERC20(USDC).transferFrom(victim, attacker, balance);
    // Repeat for all valuable assets
}
```

### Step 4: Mint Day Execution
- Create urgency with timers and "selling fast" messaging
- Victims connect wallets and approve malicious contracts
- Backend script monitors for new approvals
- Automatically drains valuable assets within seconds
- Counter shows fake "minted" numbers to maintain illusion

### Step 5: Disappear & Repeat
- Delete Discord, Twitter, website
- Move funds through mixers
- Cash out via DEXs and exchanges
- Launch next fake project with new name/brand

**Repeat time:** 2-4 weeks per project

## What Bola Should Have Done

### Before Minting

<Check>**Verify the contract address independently** - Check official announcements, compare with Etherscan, don't trust addresses shown on random websites</Check>

<Check>**Research the team** - Real names, portfolio history, previous successful projects. Anonymous teams + new project = extreme caution</Check>

<Check>**Check for smart contract audit** - Reputable audit from CertiK, Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, etc. with publicly accessible report</Check>

<Check>**Look for community warnings** - Search "[project name] + scam" on Twitter and Google before minting</Check>

<Check>**Verify social accounts** - Check when Twitter account was created, follower quality (many bots?), engagement authenticity</Check>

### During The Mint

<Check>**READ the transaction details carefully** - Never rush. If it's `setApprovalForAll` or similar permission request, STOP and investigate</Check>

<Check>**Verify contract address matches** -Compare what MetaMask shows vs. what official sources say</Check>

<Check>**Question urgency** - Real projects don't pressure you to mint immediately without time to verify</Check>

<Check>**Use a mint-only wallet** - Separate wallet with only ETH for minting, not your valuable NFT collection</Check>

### If You've Been Hit

<Check>**Revoke approvals immediately** - [Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) or Etherscan token approval tool</Check>

<Check>**Create new wallet** - Move any remaining assets to fresh wallet; compromised one is unsafe</Check>

<Check>**Report everywhere:**
- ChainAbuse - Flag the contract and attacker addresses
- OpenSea / Blur - Report the fake collection
- Discord - Report the server (if still up)
- Twitter - Report the account
- Have I Been Drained - Check if already reported
</Check>

<Check>**Document everything** - Screenshots, transaction hashes, Discord messages before they disappear</Check>

## Action Steps: Protect Yourself

### Setup (Do This Before Your Next Mint)

1. **Create a dedicated minting wallet** - Only keep ETH for minting, never your NFT collection
2. **Bookmark trusted tools:**
   - Revoke.cash (for approval management)
   - Etherscan (for contract verification)
   - ChainAbuse (for address screening)
3. **Join legitimate NFT security communities** - Real collectors share warnings about scams
4. **Enable wallet transaction simulation** - Use wallets that show what transactions will do in plain language

### When Evaluating Projects

1. **Research the team thoroughly** - Real names, LinkedIn profiles, previous projects
2. **Verify audit reports** - Click through to auditor's site, confirm project is listed
3. **Check contract on Etherscan:**
   - When was it deployed?
   - Is it verified?
   - How many holders?
   - Any warning flags?
4. **Search for scam warnings** - Google "[project] scam", check r/NFT, ask in trusted communities
5. **Be suspicious of perfection** - Amazing art + huge community + perfect roadmap + anonymous team = likely scam
