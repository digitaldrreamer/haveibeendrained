## Meet Zainab

Zainab is 31, a project manager in Kaduna, and financially disciplined. She holds stablecoins for savings and uses crypto for international payments. She has a clear rule: she doesn't lend money easily.

She meets "Nathan" on Instagram through mutual followers. Nathan looks like a well-traveled consultant living abroad. He's respectful and consistent. Over time, they move to WhatsApp and start calling.

Nathan is attentive in a way Zainab hasn't experienced:
- remembers details
- checks in during stressful days
- talks about faith and family
- shares plans for the future

He makes Zainab feel emotionally safe.

## What Happened

### Month 1: Emotional Foundation

Nathan talks about marriage and family values. He shares photos with "his sister" and "his mother" (likely stolen from other people's profiles).

He says:

> "I want a partner who builds with me."

Zainab likes the idea.

### Month 2: Money Becomes "Building"

Nathan introduces the "build with me" theme:

> "When we marry, we'll be partners. So our finances should grow together."

He doesn't ask for money directly. Instead, he asks about her goals:
- "Do you want to buy land?"
- "Do you want to start a business?"
- "How much can you save monthly?"

Zainab answers casually.

### Month 3: The "Joint Plan"

Nathan says he has a strategy:
- keep savings in stablecoins
- use "safe" monthly compounding
- do small trades during high-confidence windows

He says:

> "I'll teach you. I don't want your money. I want our future."

Then he introduces a "joint investment platform" that supports couples:
- "joint dashboards"
- "shared goals"
- "wedding fund"

It sounds like fintech.

He says:

> "Open it in your name. I'll just guide you."

Zainab deposits ₦150,000 as a test.

The dashboard shows growth.

She withdraws ₦20,000 successfully.

Confidence rises.

### Month 4: Control Transfer

Nathan suggests:

> "To reduce mistakes, let me manage execution. I've done this for years."

He asks for:
- her account login (email/password)
- or remote access "so I can help"
- or a "shared wallet" where they pool funds

Zainab refuses remote access.

Nathan responds calmly, but emotionally:

> "So you don't trust me? After all this time?"

He makes it about love and trust, not security.

Zainab doesn't want to lose the relationship. She agrees to share her platform login (not her wallet seed phrase, but still a major control transfer).

### Month 5: The Big Push

Nathan says:

> "We're close to a big opportunity. If we hit this target, we can fund our wedding without stress."

He suggests ₦2,000,000.

Zainab hesitates. That's a lot.

Nathan applies pressure:
- "I'm doing my part."
- "This is for us."
- "Don't think small."

Zainab deposits ₦1,000,000 instead.

The dashboard grows quickly.

Then Nathan says:

> "We must add another ₦700,000 to qualify for the 'couples bonus.'"

Zainab borrows money from her cooperative and deposits ₦700,000.

### Month 6: The Final Extraction

When Zainab tries to withdraw ₦500,000, she gets:

**Withdrawal blocked — pay verification deposit.**

She messages Nathan. He says:

> "Normal. Pay it so we can close this chapter."

Zainab pays.

Then:

**Pay tax clearance fee.**

Then:

**Pay security unlock fee.**

Zainab's stomach tightens. She has already deposited ₦1.85M.

She refuses the next fee.

Nathan becomes colder:

> "You're sabotaging our future."
> "You don't believe in us."
> "If you don't pay, you'll lose everything and it will be your fault."

That's coercion through emotional attachment.

Zainab finally tells her sister.

Her sister asks a simple question:

> "Have you ever met him in person? Have you done a verified video call? Do you know his real name?"

Zainab realizes she can't answer confidently.

They search Nathan's photos with reverse image search and find them on someone else's profile.

Nathan is not Nathan.

Zainab changes her platform password immediately.

But it's too late: the platform was fake. The money is gone.

Romance scams often evolve into investment fraud by combining emotional dependence with fake crypto opportunities; consumer agencies have documented romance as a hook into bogus investments, especially crypto.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **"Future together" narrative** justified bigger and bigger deposits.
- **Control transfer:** requesting logins/remote access/shared wallet is the pivot point.
- **Shame and blame:** turning security concerns into "lack of trust."
- **Fee ladder:** classic withdrawal trap.
- **Identity deception:** stolen photos, fake family, avoid real verification.
</Warning>

---

## What Zainab Could Have Done (Prevention)

<Check>**Set a hard rule:** no money, no investments, no shared accounts until:
- verified video calls
- real identity checks
- in-person meeting (where feasible)</Check>

<Check>**Never share logins, remote access, or "let me manage it" permissions.**</Check>

<Check>**Stop at the first withdrawal fee;** consumer guidance flags "fees to withdraw" as a scam sign.</Check>

<Check>**Report quickly with full details** (IDs, usernames, URLs, screenshots, transaction info) as recommended in scam reporting guidance.</Check>

---

## Red Flags Checklist

<Warning>
- [ ] **Love/commitment escalates fast.**
- [ ] **Avoids video calls or gives excuses repeatedly.**
- [ ] **Talks about "building together" mainly through money.**
- [ ] **Pushes for shared wallets/accounts or wants to "manage it for you."**
- [ ] **Uses shame:** "If you trust me, you'll do it."
- [ ] **Platform requires extra fees to withdraw.**
- [ ] **Identity details can't be verified independently.**
</Warning>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Phase 2: Financial Integration" icon="wallet">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Phase 3: Control Transfer" icon="key">
**Month 4:** Request account access, shared wallets, or "let me manage it." Frame refusal as lack of trust.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Phase 4: Escalation" icon="arrow-up">

## Action Steps: Protect Yourself

### Prevention

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Verify Identity Before Financial Discussions" icon="id-card">
**Rule:** Require verified video calls, real identity checks, and in-person meetings (where possible) before any financial involvement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Never Share Account Access" icon="lock">
**Rule:** Never share logins, passwords, remote access, or "let me manage it" permissions. Legitimate partners don't need your account access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Beware of "Building Together" Pressure" icon="exclamation-triangle">
**Rule:** If someone frames investments as "for us" or "our future" before you've met, it's likely manipulation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Reverse Image Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
**Rule:** Use reverse image search on profile photos. If they appear on other profiles, it's a scam.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    Request verified video call. Use reverse image search on photos. Check if identity details can be verified.
