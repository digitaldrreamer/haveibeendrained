## Meet Tunde

Tunde works in a co-working space and sometimes uses a shared office laptop for work. One day, he quickly checks his Binance account on the shared laptop to verify his holdings.

He logs in using the browser's "Remember me" feature, checks his balance, and closes the tab without logging out.

He assumes the session is closed and leaves the laptop.

A colleague (or someone with access to the office) discovers that Binance is still logged in on the browser. They notice the high balance and withdraw all funds to a personal wallet before Tunde has a chance to notice.

**Loss: ₦1.85 million in just minutes.**

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Shared device access:** The laptop was accessible to multiple people.
- **Session persistence:** The "Remember me" feature kept the session active even after closing the tab.
- **No explicit logout:** Tunde didn't log out, leaving the session active.
- **High balance visibility:** The attacker could see the account balance and act quickly.
</Warning>

## Red Flags Tunde Missed

<Warning>
- [ ] **Never use shared devices for crypto accounts.**
- [ ] **Never use "Remember me" on public/shared devices.**
- [ ] **Always log out explicitly** (not just closing the tab).
- [ ] **Clear browser cache/cookies** after using on shared devices.
</Warning>
