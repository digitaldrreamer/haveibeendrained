## Meet Sola

Sola runs a small phone accessories business in Ibadan. He's active on WhatsApp—customers message him all day. He's used to random numbers reaching out.

One evening, he receives a message:

> "Hi Sola, are we still meeting tomorrow?"

He replies: "Wrong number."

The stranger says:

> "So sorry! I must have saved the wrong contact. But you seem kind. How's your day going?"

Sola laughs and replies casually.

That's how it starts.

## What Happened

### Week 1–2: Harmless Conversations

The stranger (calling herself "Hannah") chats lightly:
- business stress
- food
- movies
- short voice notes
- pictures of "daily life"

She's consistent. She responds quickly. She asks thoughtful questions.

### Week 3–4: Lifestyle + Credibility

Hannah starts posting:
- travel photos
- "work wins"
- "investment lessons"

She says she works in "finance" and learned "disciplined investing" from an uncle.

She doesn't pitch anything yet.

### Week 5–6: Soft Introduction to Investing

Hannah asks:

> "Have you ever tried crypto? It's risky if you gamble, but safe if you use strategy."

Sola says he owns a little BTC.

Hannah responds:

> "Nice. Most people lose because they don't have guidance."

She offers to show him "how she invests."

### Week 7: The Platform

Hannah sends a link to a platform with a clean UI and a customer support chat:
- "licensed"
- "regulated"
- "insured"

She says:

> "Start small. I want you to trust me."

Sola deposits ₦100,000.

Two days later, the platform shows ₦108,000.

Hannah encourages a withdrawal test.

Sola withdraws ₦10,000 successfully.

That single success flips his brain from caution to confidence.

### Week 8: Scale Up

Hannah says:

> "Now you understand. If you increase your capital, you'll see real growth."

Sola deposits ₦500,000.

The platform shows consistent growth again.

### Week 9: The "Exclusive Window"

Hannah says:

> "My uncle's group is opening a short window. We can make 25% in 10 days."

She asks Sola to deposit ₦2,000,000.

Sola doesn't have that much.

Hannah becomes softer, more emotional:

> "Sola, I wouldn't share this if I didn't care about you. I see your potential."

Sola takes a business loan and deposits ₦1,500,000.

### Week 10: Withdrawal Blocked

Sola tries to withdraw ₦300,000 to repay part of the loan.

The platform says:

**Withdrawal blocked — pay tax clearance fee of ₦180,000.**

Sola asks Hannah if it's real.

Hannah replies:

> "Yes, it's normal. You pay it once. After that, withdrawals are free."

Sola pays.

Then the platform says:

**Pay compliance deposit of ₦250,000.**

Sola panics. He has already sunk ₦1.5M + ₦180k.

Hannah applies pressure:

> "Don't stop now. You're almost there."

Sola pays.

Then the platform says:

**Pay final security verification fee of ₦120,000.**

Sola pays again.

### Week 11: Silence

Hannah stops replying.

The platform support chat goes offline.

The website starts returning errors.

Sola realizes:
- the platform was fake
- Hannah was never his friend
- his business loan is now a debt with no asset behind it

Pig-butchering scams are known for exactly this timeline: weeks or months of relationship-building before the investment "sting."

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Trust-building via consistent conversation** before any ask, which matches common pig-butchering methods.
- **Staged withdrawal success** to "prove" legitimacy.
- **Escalation into debt** (victim borrows money to keep up).
- **Fee ladder:** tax → compliance → security → "final" fees; FTC and consumer agencies warn that scammers use romance as a hook into bogus investments and additional payments.
</Warning>

## What Sola Could Have Done (Prevention)

<Check>**Treat any investment introduced by a stranger (even a friendly one) as hostile by default.**</Check>

<Check>**Enforce a personal rule:** "No video call + no in-person meeting = no money."</Check>

<Check>**Never borrow money to invest in a platform you cannot verify independently.**</Check>

<Check>**Stop immediately at the first "pay fee to withdraw" message;** this is a classic scam sign.</Check>

- [ ] **Friendship begins with "wrong number"** and becomes daily intimacy.
- [ ] **Person refuses video calls or delays meeting.**
- [ ] **They show lifestyle images to imply wealth.**
- [ ] **They introduce a platform you've never heard of.**
- [ ] **A withdrawal test works once, then the platform pushes for bigger deposits.**
- [ ] **Withdrawal later requires extra "tax/compliance/security" payments.**
- [ ] **They pressure secrecy or speed.**
</Warning>

## Action Steps: Protect Yourself

### Prevention

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Verify Identity First" icon="id-card">
**Rule:** If someone you've never met introduces investments, require video calls and identity verification before any financial discussion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Never Borrow to Invest" icon="ban">
**Rule:** Never take loans or use credit to invest in platforms introduced by strangers. This compounds the risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Research Platforms Independently" icon="magnifying-glass">
**Rule:** Verify any platform through independent sources—not through the person who introduced it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stop at First Fee" icon="exclamation-triangle">

    Report to WhatsApp, local cybercrime units, and scam reporting services.
