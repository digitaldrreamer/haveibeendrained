## Meet Ngozi

Ngozi actively trades on Uniswap V3. She follows official Uniswap announcements and sees (via a Twitter link) that Uniswap V4 is launching with a new router contract.

The tweet directs her to a "migration portal" where she can swap her V3 positions to V4.

She clicks the link and lands on what appears to be an official Uniswap site.

The page explains the V4 benefits and asks her to "approve the new V4 router" to migrate her liquidity.

She approves what she thinks is the official Uniswap V4 router contract.

Actually, it's a fake contract that drains all her tokens.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Twitter link:** The link came from what appeared to be an official announcement, but was actually a fake account or compromised account.
- **Migration language:** "Migrate to V4" sounded legitimate and necessary.
- **Official-looking site:** The fake site perfectly cloned Uniswap's design.
- **Router approval:** Approving a router contract sounds normal for protocol upgrades.
</Warning>

## Red Flags Ngozi Missed

<Warning>
- [ ] **Official Uniswap would announce upgrades on uniswap.org, not Twitter links to third-party sites.**
- [ ] **"Migrate" and "upgrade" language is weaponized by scammers** to sound legitimate.
- [ ] **Router contract address wasn't verified** on EtherScan before approval.
- [ ] **No official announcement** on Uniswap's verified channels.
</Warning>

<Check>**Verify contract addresses** for any "migration" or "upgrade."</Check>

<Check>**Check official channels:** Verify upgrades on official website, GitHub, or verified social accounts.</Check>

<Check>**Never trust Twitter links for protocol upgrades:** Always navigate to official site manually.</Check>
