## Meet Sola

Sola is a 24-year-old student in Abuja. She's new to crypto and wants to start investing. She searches for "MetaMask" on Google Play and finds an app called "MetaMask Lite" with:
- A MetaMask-like logo (slightly modified)
- 4.7-star rating (from 8,000+ reviews)
- 500K+ downloads
- Description: "Fast and secure crypto wallet for Ethereum and BSC"

The publisher name looks official-ish. The reviews are positive. She downloads it.

The app looks and feels like MetaMask. She creates a new wallet and writes down her seed phrase on paper.

Everything seems fine for a few days as she practices small transactions.

Then, one morning, her wallet is empty.

## What Happened

### Step 1: The Fake App

The "MetaMask Lite" app was not created by ConsenSys (MetaMask's maker). It was a counterfeit app created by scammers.

Google Play's app review process catches many malicious apps but not all. Fake wallet apps regularly slip through by:
- Using nearly-identical names to real apps
- Buying fake positive reviews to boost ratings
- Waiting for approval, then modifying the app's backend to steal keys
- Operating briefly before Google removes them

This particular app was on Google Play for 3 months before being removed.

### Step 2: The Seed Phrase Capture

When Sola created a wallet in the fake app, the seed phrase she entered (or that the app generated) was logged by the app's backend.

Fake wallet apps typically:
1. Let the user create a wallet normally (to seem legitimate).
2. Silently capture the seed phrase/private keys.
3. Send the keys to the attacker's server.
4. Wait for funds to be added to the wallet.

### Step 3: The Drain

Once Sola had funded her wallet with ₦1.8 million worth of crypto (over a few weeks of small purchases), the attacker (who had her seed phrase) imported her wallet into their own client and drained everything.

By the time Sola realized what happened, the funds were gone and moving through a mixer.

The app was still on her phone, working normally, unaware of the theft. She only found out when she tried to send funds and discovered a zero balance.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
1. **App store impersonation:** The fake app had a near-identical name and icon to MetaMask.
2. **Fake reviews:** The high rating (4.7 stars from thousands of reviews) created legitimacy.
3. **Time delay:** The app functioned normally for weeks before stealing, lowering user suspicion.
4. **Silent key capture:** The seed phrase was stolen without any indication.
5. **Difficult recovery:** Once the seed phrase is captured, recovery is nearly impossible.
</Warning>

## What Sola Could Have Done (Prevention)

### Before Downloading

<Check>**Verify the publisher:** Tap the publisher name in the app store. Real MetaMask is published by **ConsenSys** (verify this by going to metamask.io and checking). If the publisher is an unknown person or entity, it's fake.</Check>

<Check>**Check the official website:** Go to metamask.io and find the download link. Compare the link to what you found on the app store.</Check>

<Check>**Look for the official checkmark:** Many app stores have an "official" badge for verified publishers.</Check>

<Check>**Search "[app name] fake" on Reddit or Twitter.** If the app has issues, people will have reported it.</Check>

<Check>**Check reviews for warnings:** Search reviews for "seed phrase stolen," "lost funds," "scam." If present, it's a fake.</Check>

### If You Must Use a Mobile Wallet

<Check>**Use only official links from the company's website.** Not search results, not ads, not links from strangers.</Check>

<Check>**Use a hardware wallet instead.** For significant holdings, use a hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor) with a Bluetooth connection to your phone. Hardware wallets never expose the seed phrase.</Check>

<Check>**Keep mobile wallets small.** Only keep the amount you'll spend in a week on a mobile wallet. Store bulk holdings elsewhere.</Check>

### If You've Already Imported a Seed Phrase Into an Unknown Wallet

<Check>**Assume the seed phrase is compromised.**</Check>

<Check>**Create a new seed phrase in an official wallet** (Ledger, Trezor, or verified MetaMask on desktop).</Check>

<Check>**Move all remaining funds to the new wallet immediately.**</Check>

<Check>**Never use the old seed phrase again.**</Check>

## Red Flags Sola Missed

<Warning>
- [ ] **Publisher name:** The real MetaMask is published by ConsenSys, not a random individual.
- [ ] **Suspicious reviews:** All positive reviews might indicate fake reviews (real apps have some 1-star reviews).
- [ ] **Similar but different name:** "MetaMask Lite" is suspiciously similar to "MetaMask."
- [ ] **No official verification badge:** Official app store pages often have badges indicating the publisher is verified.
</Warning>
