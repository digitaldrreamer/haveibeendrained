## Meet Jamal

Jamal is a 26-year-old business student in Accra. One day, he gets a WhatsApp message from an unknown number: "Hi, sorry, wrong number. But hey, how's your day going?"

It's a casual, friendly opening. Jamal responds: "Lol, all good. What's up?"

Thus begins a two-month friendship.

## What Happened

### Months 1-2: Building Friendship

The person on the other end (claiming to be "Zainab," a female engineer based in the US) was friendly, funny, and genuinely interested in Jamal's life. They chatted almost daily about everything—memes, work stress, family, relationships.

Two months in, Zainab said: "You know, I've grown to really value our friendship. You're such a positive person, and I trust you. I want to introduce you to something that's changed my life."

### The Investment Pitch

She explained a "private investment group" that shares high-return opportunities with trusted members. The current opportunity: a real estate tokenization project with projected 5–7% monthly returns.

She offered to "sponsor" Jamal into the group. All he had to do was deposit the initial capital (₦500,000) and she would guide him.

Jamal hesitated. But this was someone he'd been talking to for two months. She felt like a friend.

He deposited ₦500,000.

### Months 3-4: Fake Returns

For two months, he received "returns": ₦30,000–₦35,000 monthly. The "investment dashboard" looked professional.

### The Personal Emergency

Then Zainab said she had a personal emergency and needed help. Could Jamal loan her ₦700,000? She promised to pay it back in a month.

Jamal sent it.

### The Final Request

A month later, she said: "I'm having trouble accessing my funds due to a banking issue. Can you help me transfer the ₦700,000 from your investment account to my personal account? It's just a temporary move; I'll send it right back to your investment."

Jamal did (from his investment account, not realizing this was a test of his willingness to move money without scrutiny).

The money never came back. Zainab disappeared.

**Total loss: ₦1.2 million (₦500k initial + ₦700k "loan").**

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **No physical contact required:** Everything happened via text, making it scalable and low-risk for the scammer.
- **Months of bonding:** By the time money was involved, Jamal felt like he had a real friend.
- **Gradual escalation:** First a small investment (feels safe), then a "loan" (emotional appeal), then moving money (testing compliance).
</Warning>

## Red Flags (What Jamal Missed)

<Warning>
- [ ] **A friendship that starts with a "wrong number"** and quickly becomes very close.
- [ ] **Someone you have never video-called or met in person** suddenly offering investment access.
- [ ] **Requests for personal loans** despite not being able to explain why.
- [ ] **Investment dashboards** that show unusual consistency and are not independently verifiable.
</Warning>

## How Wrong Number Scams Work

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The Opening" icon="phone">
**Step 1:** Send a "wrong number" message to random contacts. This feels innocent and creates an opening for conversation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Building Trust" icon="handshake">
**Step 2:** Engage in friendly, daily conversations for weeks or months. Share personal details, build emotional connection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Investment Introduction" icon="chart-line">
**Step 3:** After trust is established, introduce an "investment opportunity" or "private group" with high returns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Escalation" icon="arrow-up">
**Step 4:** Request larger amounts—first as investment, then as "loans" or "emergency help."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Disappearance" icon="ghost">
**Step 5:** Once maximum extraction is achieved, disappear. The victim realizes they never actually knew this person.
