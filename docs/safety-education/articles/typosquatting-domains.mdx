## What Is Typosquatting?

**Typosquatting** (also called URL hijacking) is registering domain names that are nearly identical to legitimate websites, relying on small typos or visual similarities to trick users into visiting fake sites.

In crypto, typosquatted domains are the #1 delivery mechanism for phishing attacks and wallet drainers.

### Examples:

| Legitimate Site | Typosquatted Variants |
|----------------|----------------------|
| `metamask.io` | `meta-mask.io`, `metamaask.io`, `metarnask.io`, `metamask.com` |
| `uniswap.org` | `uniswwap.org`, `uni-swap.org`, `unisvvap.org`, `uniswap.com` |
| `opensea.io` | `opensae.io`, `open-sea.io`, `opensea.com`, `opensεa.io` (Greek epsilon) |

The difference might be **a single character**—easy to miss when you're in a hurry or on mobile.

## The Anatomy of a Typosquat Attack

### Phase 1: Domain Registration

**When:** Immediately after a new crypto project, exchange, or protocol launches

**How:**
- Scammers monitor announcements on Twitter, Discord, ProductHunt
- Within hours, they register dozens of typosquatted variants
- Cost: $10-$50 per domain
- Profit potential: Thousands to millions per successful campaign

**Example:** When ChatGPT launched, over **600 typosquatted domains** were registered within the first month.

### Phase 2: Website Cloning

**What they copy:**
- Exact HTML/CSS from the real site
- Logos, branding, color schemes
- Layout and user flow
- Even SSL certificates (HTTPS doesn't mean safe!)

**What they change:**
- Wallet connection code → points to drainer contract
- Form submissions → send data to attacker
- Download links → serve malware instead of legitimate apps

**Time to clone:** 1-4 hours with automation tools

### Phase 3: Traffic Generation

**How users end up on fake sites:**

1. **Organic typos** - Users mistype URLs directly in browsers
2. **Phishing emails** - Fake notifications with typosquatted links
3. **Social media ads** - Paid promotion on Twitter, Facebook, Google
4. **Discord/Telegram DMs** - Fake support sending malicious links
5. **Search engine poisoning** - Fake sites ranking high for slight misspellings

**Example traffic path:**
- User googles "metamask wallet"
- Clicks sponsored link (paid ad from scammer)
- Goes to `metamaask.io` instead of `metamask.io`
- Connects wallet → drainer executes

### Phase 4: The Attack

**Variant 1: Wallet Drainer**
- User connects wallet to fake site
- Site requests malicious approval
- Wallet is drained within seconds

**Variant 2: Credential Phishing**
- User enters exchange login credentials
- Attacker captures username/password/2FA
- Account is later drained

**Variant 3: Malware Distribution**
- User downloads "official wallet app"
- Actually downloads malware/fake wallet
- Seed phrase is stolen when user sets up wallet

## Common Typosquatting Patterns

### 1. Character Substitution

**Pattern:** Replace letters with visually similar ones

| Type | Example Original | Typosquat |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| **Double letters** | `binance.com` | `binnance.com`, `binaance.com` |
| **Similar letters** | `coinbase.com` | `coinbace.com` (e→c), `coinbaes.com` |
| **Number substitution** | `crypto.com` | `crypt0.com` (o→0), `ctypto.com` |

### 2. Homoglyph Attacks

**Pattern:** Use characters from different alphabets that look identical

**Examples:**
- `аmazon.com` - The "а" is Cyrillic, not Latin
- `аpple.com` - Cyrillic "а"  
- `googlе.com` - Cyrillic "е"

**Why it's dangerous:** **Visually indistinguishable** from the real domain.

### 3. Missing or Extra Characters

**Pattern:** Add/remove letters

| Type | Original | Typosquat |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Missing letter** | `phantom.app` | `phntom.app`, `phatom.app` |
| **Extra letter** | `ledger.com` | `leddger.com`, `ledgger.com` |
| **Wrong order** | `pancakeswap.finance` | `pacnakeswap.finance` |

### 4. Hyphenation & Punctuation

**Pattern:** Add hyphens or dots where they don't belong

- `meta-mask.io` (real: `metamask.io`)
- `coin.base.com` (real: `coinbase.com`)
- `uni-swap.org` (real: `uniswap.org`)

### 5. TLD (Top-Level Domain) Variations

**Pattern:** Use different endings

| Original TLD | Typosquat TLDs |
|--------------|----------------|
| `.io` | `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.co` |
| `.com` | `.io`, `.net`, `.co`, `.org` |
| `.org` | `.com`, `.io`, `.finance` |

**Example:** `uniswap.org` is real, but `uniswap.com` could be a scam.

### 6. Subdomain Tricks

**Pattern:** Put the real

 domain in a subdomain

- `coinbase.scam-site.com` (looks like "coinbase" but isn't)
- `https://metamask.io.fake-wallet.com`

**Why it fools people:** The real brand name appears in the URL, but it's not the actual domain.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: The Uniswap Phishing (2023)

**What happened:**
- Scammers registered `uniswwap.org` (extra "w")
- Cloned the real Uniswap interface
- Ran Google Ads targeting "Uniswap" searches
- Users connected wallets, approved malicious contracts
- **Estimated losses:** $500,000+ before shutdown

**Red flag users missed:** The double "ww" in the URL

### Case Study 2: MetaMask Fake Extension

**What happened:**
- Fake "MetaMask" extension uploaded to Chrome Web Store
- Name: "MetaMask" (identical)
- Icon: Identical to real extension
- Downloaded by 10,000+ users before removal
- All seed phrases entered were sent to attackers

**How it worked:** Used typosquatted publisher name and similar extension ID

### Case Study 3: The Ammatina Grant Scam (Lisa's Story)

**What happened:**
- Real grant program: `ammatina-funds.com`
- Typosquat: `arnrnatina-funds.com` (double "r", missing "i")
- Email phishing campaign targeted grant applicants
- Victims connected wallets to fake claim portal
- **Individual losses:** $50,000-$200,000 per victim

## How to Protect Yourself

### Before Visiting ANY Crypto Site

<Steps>
  <Step title="Type URLs Manually or Use Bookmarks">
    **Never click links** in emails, DMs, or social media for important sites. Type them directly into the browser or use saved bookmarks.
    
    **Pro tip:** Create a "Crypto - Verified" bookmark folder with all your important sites the FIRST time you verify them.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Character-by-Character">
    Before hitting Enter, examine the URL:
    - Count letters (uniswap = 7 letters, not 8)
    - Check for hyphens or dots that shouldn't be there
    - Verify the TLD (.io vs .com vs .org)
    - Look for subtle character swaps
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Browser Security Extensions">
    Install anti-phishing tools:
    - **MetaMask** - Has built-in phishing detection
    - **Wallet Guard** - Browser extension that warns about scam sites
    - **Google Safe Browsing** - Built into Chrome/Firefox
    - **Netcraft Extension** - Phishing protection
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Domain Age and Registration">
    Use WHOIS lookup tools:
    - [who.is](https://who.is)
    - [whois.domaintools.com](https://whois.domaintools.com)
    
    **Red flags:**
    - Domain registered within last few weeks/months
    - Privacy protection hiding owner info
    - Registration date doesn't match project launch date
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify SSL Certificate Details">
    Click the padlock icon in the browser:
    - Check the certificate is issued to the right company
    - Verify the domain exactly matches
    - Look for extended validation (EV) certificates (show company name)
    
    **NOTE:** HTTPS/SSL does NOT mean safe—scammers get certificates too!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Red Flags Checklist

<Warning>
- [ ] URL came from an **email, DM, or unsolicited message**
- [ ] Domain has **extra/missing/different letters** when compared to official
- [ ] TLD is different (`.com` instead of expected `.io`)
- [ ] Domain has **hyphens or dots** in unexpected places
- [ ] Site appeared in **sponsored search results** (ads, not organic)
- [ ] WHOIS shows **domain registered very recently**
- [ ] Site asks you to **connect wallet immediately** without clear context
- [ ] SSL certificate shows **different company name** than expected
- [ ] Site has **no "About," "Team," or "Contact"** pages (just the main function)
</Warning>
