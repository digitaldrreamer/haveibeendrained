## Meet Marcus

Marcus is a 35-year-old business manager who watches crypto YouTube videos during his lunch break. One day, he searches for "Binance live stream" and finds a video that appears in the results.

It's titled: **"BINANCE LIVE: ETH GIVEAWAY – Send 0.5 ETH to Receive 5 ETH!"**

The video shows:
- A Binance-branded studio setup
- A professional-looking host (looks like a real Binance employee or someone hired to pose as one)
- A QR code displayed repeatedly throughout the video
- Chat comments (simulated or bots) saying "I just received 2 ETH!" and "This is real!"
- A crypto address shown in the video title and comments

Marcus thinks: "This is a legitimate Binance livestream promoting an ETH giveaway. Let me participate."

## What Happened

### Step 1: The Fake Livestream

The video is not a legitimate Binance livestream. It's a recorded video (not actually live) uploaded to YouTube to deceive people. The upload may be:
- A cloned YouTube channel (similar name to Binance's real channel).
- A video uploaded to someone's personal channel and promoted via ads.
- A deepfake or stock footage combined with added graphics.

The QR code in the video links to a wallet address controlled by the scammer.

### Step 2: The Send

Marcus scans the QR code (which displays a crypto wallet address) and sends 0.5 ETH (~₦500,000) to the address.

He waits for the 5 ETH (~₦5,000,000) to arrive.

It never does.

The video continues to claim that "senders are receiving rewards," but in reality, it's just bait to get more people to send.

### Step 3: The Realization

Marcus checks the wallet address on EtherScan. He sees dozens of transactions from other victims, all sending ETH to the same address. None of them received 5 ETH back.

The wallet has been draining ETH to mixing services and exchanges.

Marcus lost ₦500,000 and realizes he was fooled by a fake video.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
1. **Video deception:** It looked like a professional livestream but was either recorded or deepfaked.
2. **QR code ease:** People scan QR codes without thinking, and the code bypasses the safety check of reading an address manually.
3. **Fake comments:** Simulated chat messages created the illusion that others were successfully participating.
4. **Authority:** The Binance branding and professional production value made it seem legitimate.
</Warning>

## What Marcus Could Have Done (Prevention)

### Before Scanning or Sending

<Check>**Verify the YouTube channel.** Check if it's Binance's official channel by visiting Binance.com and finding their official YouTube link. Compare.</Check>

<Check>**Never scan QR codes in videos for financial transactions.** Always manually type addresses.</Check>

<Check>**Do not participate in "giveaways" that ask you to send money first.** This rule applies universally.</Check>

<Check>**Check the video's upload date and comments.** Real livestreams have dated comments; fake ones may show artificial or missing comments.</Check>

- [ ] **QR codes are used to hide the actual address.**
