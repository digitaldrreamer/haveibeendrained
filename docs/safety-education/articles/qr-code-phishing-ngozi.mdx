## Meet Ngozi

Ngozi is an active Curve Finance user. She sees a post in a Curve Discord channel:

> "Curve Protocol Emergency Update – Please scan the QR code below to migrate to the new contract. You must do this within 24 hours or your liquidity will be at risk!"

Below is a QR code. The post looks official (similar formatting to real Curve announcements).

Ngozi scans the QR code with her phone.

It takes her to a URL that looks like Curve's site but is actually a fake. When she connects her wallet, the attacker gains approval access and drains her liquidity provider tokens.

**Loss: ₦600,000 in LP tokens.**

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **QR code hides the real URL:** People scan without seeing the actual destination.
- **Official-looking post:** The formatting matched real Curve announcements.
- **Urgency pressure:** "Within 24 hours or your liquidity will be at risk" created FOMO.
- **Trust in community:** The post was in an official Discord channel, making it seem legitimate.
</Warning>

## Red Flags Ngozi Missed

<Warning>
- [ ] **Official protocols post updates on official channels, not QR codes in Discord.**
- [ ] **QR codes hide the real URL.** Never scan QR codes for financial transactions.
- [ ] **"Act within 24 hours or lose funds" is urgency-based pressure.**
- [ ] **The post may have been from a compromised account or fake admin.**
</Warning>
