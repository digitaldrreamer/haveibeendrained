## Meet Kunle

Kunle is a 28-year-old software engineer at a Lagos fintech startup. He's single, works long hours, and hasn't had time to seriously date. He joins Hinge, a dating app, and starts matching with women.

One match stands out: **"Miracle"** (profile picture: beautiful Black woman, early 30s, based in "London," working in "venture capital").

Her messages are thoughtful, funny, and increasingly personal. She asks about his dreams, his family, his goals. Unlike other matches, Miracle keeps the conversation going every day for weeks.

They move to WhatsApp and call occasionally (though she always has an excuse for video calls: "Camera is broken," "I'm about to catch a flight," "My WiFi is terrible").

After six weeks, Miracle says: "Kunle, I've grown very close to you. I know we haven't met yet, but I feel like I'm falling for you. I want to see this go somewhere real."

Kunle is thrilled. He's been thinking the same thing.

## What Happened

### Phase 1: Isolation & Emotional Deepening (Weeks 1–6)

Miracle positioned herself as successful, ambitious, and, most importantly, interested only in Kunle. She made him feel special—she would wake up early to message him, she remembered small details about his family, and she gradually shifted conversations toward more intimate topics.

She also asked strategic questions: "How much do you make?", "Do you have savings?", "Are you interested in growing your wealth?"

### Phase 2: The Investment Opportunity (Week 7)

Miracle said: "I'm about to close a big deal—a pre-IPO opportunity in a fintech platform. My firm is raising funds, and I can get you in before the round closes. Returns are expected to be 40–60% in 18 months."

She sent a document (PDF) with the company details. It looked professional: pitch deck, team bios, financial projections.

She added: "I've already put in £50,000. I can only guarantee you a spot if you move quickly—the round closes in a week."

Kunle's rational mind had doubts. A 40% return sounded high. But Miracle was someone he trusted now. And she wouldn't risk her own money on something fake, would she?

He asked: "How do I get in?"

"Transfer the funds to the investment account. I'll arrange it for you and manage your position."

Kunle transferred ₦500,000.

Miracle sent him a screenshot of a "investment dashboard" (a fake frontend): "Kunle's Investment: ₦500,000. Expected Return (18 months): ₦800,000. Status: Locked in pre-IPO round."

He was thrilled. She was thrilled.

### Phase 3: Deepening Trust with Small Wins (Weeks 8–10)

Over the next three weeks, the dashboard showed "valuation updates" (fake). The "investment" had "appreciated" to ₦550,000.

Miracle also shared her own screenshots, showing her position had grown.

She also said: "Now that we're building something together, I want to build a future with you too. Let's make this work when I come to Nigeria in three months."

Kunle was in love.

### Phase 4: The Crisis (Week 11)

Miracle called (a rare video call, during which she had the camera strategically pointed away from her face). She sounded distressed.

"Kunle, I have a problem. My firm had a payment processing issue with the pre-IPO round. To complete the final round of funding and secure everyone's positions, I need to inject additional capital immediately—but my account is frozen."

She paused. "I've already put in so much. I don't have access to more right now. But you... you could help. If you put in ₦1 million more, I can use it to secure both our positions, and once the round closes in 48 hours, both investments will be unlocked and grow."

Red flags: urgent timing, emotional pressure, a specific "ask," a crisis framing.

But Kunle was emotionally invested now. He loved her. And logically, it seemed like she was in the same boat as him—she needed the capital to secure their shared investment.

He sent ₦1 million.

### Phase 5: The Extraction (Weeks 12–13)

Two days later, Miracle said there was "another issue"—a compliance fee. Then an "insurance deposit." Then a "tax clearance."

Each demand was between ₦200,000 and ₦500,000.

Over two weeks, Kunle sent a total of ₦1.5 million in additional "fees."

Then Miracle went silent.

He called. No answer. She had disappeared from WhatsApp. The "investment dashboard" was no longer accessible. The "company" website had been taken down.

Kunle was devastated. Not just financially (₦2.5 million loss), but emotionally. The person he thought he loved was a scammer, and they had been running this romance scam since day one.

He realized that the entire relationship—from the first message to the "love" declarations—was a script designed to manipulate him into trusting her and eventually sending money.

**Total loss: ₦2.5 million (~$1,600 USD) + emotional trauma.**

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Emotional intimacy first, financial ask second:** By the time money was involved, Kunle had months of trust built up.
- **The investment sounded plausible:** It was a specific opportunity, not "get rich quick," which made it feel real.
- **Reciprocal investment:** The scammer claimed to have invested too, which made Kunle feel like they were in it together.
- **Crisis framing:** The "urgency" of needing more money exploited Kunle's desire to help someone he "loved."
- **Gradual fee escalation:** Rather than one large ask, multiple smaller fees made each one seem more reasonable.
</Warning>

## Red Flags (What Kunle Missed)

<Warning>
- [ ] **They never video-called or met in person** despite months of "dating."
- [ ] **They knew he had savings/disposable income** (strategic questioning).
- [ ] **The "investment opportunity" came after emotional bonding** was established.
- [ ] **Investment documents could not be independently verified.**
- [ ] **When he sent the money, it went to a personal/transfer account**, not an official entity.
- [ ] **After the first investment, there was immediate pressure for a second.**
</Warning>

## If You Are Being Targeted

### Signs

<Warning>
- Someone from a dating app is unusually engaged and moves conversations quickly to personal/intimate territory.
- They make excuses for not video-calling.
- They mention investment opportunities, especially ones exclusive to them.
- They ask specific questions about your financial situation.
</Warning>

### What to Do

<Steps>
  <Step title="Slow Down">
    Real relationships develop over months, not weeks.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Video-Call Insist">
    If they keep making excuses, it's a scam.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Independently">
    Even if they claim to have invested, you cannot verify their claims.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Never Send Money">
    Never send money to "help" someone you've met online.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Tell a Trusted Friend">
    If they think the relationship is a scam, listen.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Action Steps: Protect Yourself

### Prevention

<Check>**Meet in person before ANY financial discussions.** Real romance involves physical meetings.</Check>

<Check>**Do not invest based on someone you've only met online.**</Check>

<Check>**Verify investment opportunities independently**—check the company's official website, licensing, and third-party reviews.</Check>

<Check>**Never send money to "secure" an investment or to help a romantic partner with a financial emergency.** If it's real, they should use their own resources or official channels.</Check>

<Check>**Talk to someone you trust** if a potential partner is pushing you toward financial commitments.</Check>

### If You Already Sent Money

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stop Communicating Immediately">
    Do not send more.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Preserve All Evidence">
    Messages, emails, and transaction records.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Report to the Platform">
    Report to the platform where you met them (Hinge, Bumble, etc.).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Report to Your Bank">
    Report to your bank and local cybercrime unit.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Do Not Engage with Recovery Scammers">
    Do not engage with recovery scammers who will DM you later (see [Recovery Scam Trap](/safety-education/articles/recovery-scam-trap)).
  </Step>
</Steps>
