## Meet Adekunle

Adekunle is a 33-year-old DeFi farmer. He searches for high-yield opportunities and comes across what looks like Curve Finance:

**Domain:** `curve-finance-dao.io`  
**Offer:** "50% APY on stablecoin pools"

He connects his wallet and deposits ₦1 million worth of USDC to the pool.

He's asked to approve the deposit (standard for yield farming).

The approval is granted to a contract that claims to be Curve's router.

Within minutes, instead of receiving LP tokens, all his USDC is drained to the attacker's address.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Unrealistic APY:** 50% APY is far higher than legitimate Curve pools (typically 2-8%).
- **Domain typosquatting:** `curve-finance-dao.io` vs. real `curve.fi`.
- **Yield farming approval:** The approval request seemed normal for DeFi farming.
- **Greed:** The high APY promise overrode skepticism.
</Warning>

## Red Flags Adekunle Missed

<Warning>
- [ ] **50% APY is unrealistically high.** Real Curve pools offer 2-8% APY typically.
- [ ] **Domain:** `curve-finance-dao.io` vs. real `curve.fi`.
- [ ] **No mention of audit or security.** Fake sites avoid discussing security.
- [ ] **Contract address wasn't verified** before approval.
</Warning>
