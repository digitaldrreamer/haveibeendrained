## Meet Chidi

Chidi is a 35-year-old business owner running a successful goods importation business. A supplier mentioned a "investment platform" that promised safe, moderate returns: 8% annually with quarterly distributions.

The site looked legit: company details, team bios, an office address, and a "Licensed Investment Manager" credential (which, upon later research, was from a non-existent regulatory body).

Chidi invested ₦1 million.

## What Happened

### Months 1-3: Building Trust

For three months, Chidi received ₦20,000 quarterly (2% per quarter, matching the 8% annual claim). The money came to his bank account, so he felt it was real.

Encouraged, he deposited ₦800,000 more.

### Month 12: Attempting Withdrawal

At month 12, his dashboard showed ₦1.8 million. He decided to withdraw ₦500,000 for a business opportunity.

**First Fee:** "Please note: Tax withholding is 10% per regulatory requirements." ₦50,000 deducted.

He accepted and requested the withdrawal. The site said: "Processing."

### Week 1: Compliance Fee

**One week later:** "Your withdrawal is pending compliance verification. To release funds, a one-time compliance fee of ₦50,000 is required."

He paid, assuming it was legitimate.

### Week 2: Wire Transfer Fee

**One week later:** "Congratulations! Your withdrawal has been approved. Due to international banking delays, a wire transfer fee of ₦80,000 is required."

He paid.

### Week 3: Processing Fee

**One week later:** "Your funds are in our remittance partner's queue. A final processing fee of ₦100,000 is required to finalize the transfer."

Chidi had now paid ₦280,000 in fees on top of the initial ₦50,000 tax. He asked for a refund of the fees if the withdrawal could not go through.

The site said fees were non-refundable per the terms of service (which he had never read).

He escalated to "customer support," which provided canned responses and never resolved the issue.

Chidi realized the original "quarterly returns" were likely stolen from new deposits (Ponzi mechanics), and the entire withdrawal process was designed to extract maximum fees.

**Total loss: ₦1,330,000 (the fees + the original deposit, which is inaccessible).**

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Quarterly "returns" to build trust** in the first months.
- **Escalating fees trap:** Each fee is justified as regulatory or operational, with the promise that one more payment will release the funds.
- **Sunk cost psychology:** Having "received" some returns, the victim is more willing to pay additional fees.
</Warning>

## Red Flags (What Chidi Missed)

<Warning>
- [ ] **Legitimate platforms never charge fees to withdraw your own money.**
- [ ] **"Tax withholding," "compliance fees," and "wire fees"** are classic language used in these scams.
- [ ] **The "team" and "office" on the website** were likely fake.
</Warning>

## How Withdrawal Trap Scams Work

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Build Trust First" icon="handshake">
**Phase 1:** Show small, regular returns to build trust. These come from new deposits (Ponzi) or are completely fake.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="First Fee Request" icon="banknote">
**Phase 2:** When withdrawal is requested, introduce the first "tax" or "compliance" fee. This seems reasonable after seeing "profits."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Escalating Fees" icon="arrow-up">
**Phase 3:** Each fee is followed by another. The victim has already invested, so paying "one more fee" seems logical.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Never Release Funds" icon="lock">
**Phase 4:** Funds are never released. The platform may disappear or continue requesting fees indefinitely.
  </Accordion>

## Action Steps

### Prevention

<Check>**If a platform asks for a fee to withdraw your own funds, stop immediately** and withdraw all remaining balance.</Check>

<Check>**Never believe "one more fee" will release your funds.**</Check>

<Check>**Verify regulatory licenses** directly on the regulator's website, not via links on the platform's site.</Check>

### If You're Already Trapped

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stop Paying Fees">
    Do not pay any additional fees, regardless of promises.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Document Everything">
    Screenshots of all fee requests, transaction records, communications.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Report to Authorities">
    Report to SEC, EFCC, and your bank.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Report the Platform">
    Report to ChainAbuse and warn others on social media.
  </Step>
