## Meet Kofi

Kofi has accounts on several exchanges and wallets. He finds a tool called "Wallet Key Recovery Helper" that claims to:
- Batch import multiple wallet keys
- Consolidate holdings across wallets
- Simplify portfolio management

He downloads the tool and runs it.

The tool asks for his private keys to "import" them into a unified interface.

He provides the keys.

The tool processes them and then displays an interface showing all his holdings consolidated.

But the tool has silently uploaded his keys to the attacker's server.

Within hours, all his wallets are drained.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Plausible functionality:** The tool's claimed features (batch import, consolidation) sounded useful.
- **Professional appearance:** The tool looked legitimate and functional.
- **Direct key request:** The tool asked for private keys directly, which users shouldn't provide.
- **Silent exfiltration:** Keys were uploaded without user knowledge.
</Warning>
