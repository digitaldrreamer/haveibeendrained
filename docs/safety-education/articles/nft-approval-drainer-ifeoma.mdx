## Meet Ifeoma

Ifeoma is a 28-year-old NFT collector. She owns a few thousand dollars worth of NFTs and follows various projects. She's active in Discord communities for art NFTs.

One day, in a Discord server, someone posts:

> "Free NFT drop! Mint now: [link] — First 100 minters get a valuable art NFT. No gas fees (we're covering them). Connect wallet to claim."

The link takes her to a clean website with a "Mint" button.

She connects her MetaMask wallet.

## What Happened

### Step 1: The Mint Page

The page looks professional:
- Project branding
- Mint progress bar (showing "47/100 minted")
- "Mint" button
- "No gas fees" banner

She clicks "Mint."

### Step 2: The Hidden Approval

MetaMask pops up with a transaction:

> "Mint1NFT Contract
> 
> Do you want to call mintNFT?
> 
> Gas: 0.005 ETH"

It looks like a normal mint transaction. Ifeoma approves.

What she doesn't know: the transaction also includes a call to `setApprovalForAll()`, which grants the attacker's contract unlimited rights to transfer any of her NFTs.

### Step 3: The Drain

Once approved, the attacker's contract immediately:
1. Searches her wallet for all NFTs.
2. Transfers every NFT to the attacker's address.
3. Sells the NFTs on OpenSea or another marketplace.

Ifeoma loses her entire NFT portfolio—worth ₦4.5 million.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Hidden approval:** The `setApprovalForAll()` was buried in the mint transaction, not clearly visible.
- **Legitimate-sounding mint:** "Free NFT" sounds reasonable; mints are normal in the NFT space.
- **Professional UI:** The website looked official.
- **"No gas fees" promise:** Made the offer seem generous and legitimate.
</Warning>

## Red Flags Ifeoma Missed

<Warning>
- [ ] **"No gas fees" claim:** Projects that claim to cover gas fees are suspicious (it's technically possible but rare).
- [ ] **Discord links to unseen projects:** Always verify project credibility independently.
- [ ] **Approval request:** Even for NFT mints, verify the smart contract before approving.
- [ ] **Hidden `setApprovalForAll()`:** The approval was buried in the transaction, not clearly shown.
</Warning>

## Prevention

<Check>**Check the contract address** on OpenSea or EtherScan before minting.</Check>

<Check>**Look for `setApprovalForAll()` in the transaction details.** If present, it's a red flag unless you're absolutely sure it's necessary.</Check>

<Check>**Use wallets with simulation** (Rabby) that show what a transaction will do.</Check>

<Check>**Verify project legitimacy:** Check if the project has official website, verified Twitter, and real community.</Check>

<Check>**Be suspicious of "free" mints:** Real projects rarely offer completely free mints with no gas fees.</Check>
