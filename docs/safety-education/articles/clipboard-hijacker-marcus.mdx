## Meet Marcus

Marcus is an active crypto trader on his Windows laptop. He frequently copies and pastes wallet addresses when sending tokens.

One day, he downloads what claims to be a "Trading Bot" tool from a crypto forum. The tool supposedly automates small profitable trades.

He installs it.

## What Happened

### Step 1: The Malware Installation

The "Trading Bot" is actually a clipboard hijacker. Once installed, it runs silently in the background.

The malware's job: whenever Marcus copies a crypto wallet address to his clipboard, the malware replaces it with a different address (one controlled by the scammer).

### Step 2: The Swap

A few days later, Marcus wants to sell some tokens. He copies a recipient address (his own wallet on another exchange) to his clipboard.

He's about to paste it into a DEX interface to initiate the token swap.

But before he pastes, he (fortunately) decides to visually verify the address is correct by checking it manually.

He notices: the address he's about to paste doesn't match what he copied.

His original address started with `0x1A2B...` but the clipboard now shows `0x9Z8Y...`

He realizes his clipboard has been hijacked.

### Step 3: The Investigation

Marcus runs an antivirus scan and discovers the "Trading Bot" malware.

He removes it immediately, but realizes that if he hadn't double-checked that address, he would have sent ₦500,000 to the scammer's wallet instead of his own.

**Potential loss prevented:** ₦500,000+

## Where the Scammer Almost Won

<Warning>
- **Legitimate-sounding tool:** The "Trading Bot" seemed plausible.
- **Silent malware:** Clipboard hijackers run invisibly.
- **No obvious indication:** Marcus's clipboard was modified without notification.
- **Easy target:** Traders copy addresses frequently, making them prime targets.
</Warning>

## What Marcus Did Right (and Could Have Done Earlier)

<Check>**He visually verified the address before sending.** This saved him.</Check>

<Check>**He could have prevented this by:** Not installing untrusted software, running antivirus/antimalware regularly, typing critical addresses manually instead of copying and pasting, and using a hardware wallet (less vulnerable to clipboard malware).</Check>

---

## Red Flags

<Warning>
- [ ] **Software from untrusted sources:** Crypto forums, Telegram links, Reddit downloads.
- [ ] **Too-good-to-be-true tools:** "Trading bot," "mining software," "airdrop helpers."
- [ ] **Clipboard changes:** If you copy an address and it looks different when you paste, malware is present.
</Warning>
