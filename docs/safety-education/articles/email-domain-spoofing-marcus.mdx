## Meet Marcus

Marcus uses Binance and stakes some ETH. One day, he receives an email:

**Subject:** "Your Staking Reward Unlock Notification – Action Required"

The email looks like it's from Binance:
- Uses Binance's logo
- References his actual staking
- Says his staking rewards are locked and require "account verification"
- Includes a link to verify: `https://binance-verify-account.com/unlock-staking`

Marcus clicks and enters his credentials on the fake site.

The attacker now has his email and password (or exchange credentials if he used the same password).

## What Happened

The attacker logs into Marcus's real Binance account (if he reused the password) or uses the email to reset his password.

They withdraw his funds to another wallet or exchange.

**Loss: ₦2.5M in holdings.**

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
- **Email spoofing:** The email looked like it came from Binance, using their branding and referencing real account activity.
- **Fake domain:** `binance-verify-account.com` looked legitimate but was not an official Binance domain.
- **Plausible scenario:** Using real features (staking) made the email seem legitimate.
- **Credential harvesting:** The fake site captured login credentials.
</Warning>

## Red Flags Marcus Missed

<Warning>
- [ ] **Email sender domain:** Check if it's actually `@binance.com`, not `@binance-verify.com` or similar.
- [ ] **The link domain:** `binance-verify-account.com` is not a Binance domain.
- [ ] **Requested verification:** Binance doesn't ask for login verification via email links.
- [ ] **Urgency language:** "Action Required" is a common phishing tactic.
</Warning>

## Prevention

<Check>**Check email headers:** Look at the actual sender email, not just the display name.</Check>

<Check>**Use SPF/DMARC checking:** Some email providers show warnings if the email's domain authentication fails.</Check>

<Check>**Never click account verification links in emails.** Go directly to the site.</Check>

<Check>**Enable 2FA on exchanges** with a non-SMS method (authenticator app or hardware key).</Check>

<Check>**Verify domain carefully:** Official Binance domains are `binance.com`, `binance.us`, etc. Check the exact domain.</Check>
