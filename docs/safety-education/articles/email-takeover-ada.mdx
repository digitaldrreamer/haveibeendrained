## Meet Ada

Ada is a 30-year-old business manager who uses one email address for everything: crypto exchange accounts, wallet recovery, banking, business accounts.

That email is `ada.business@gmail.com`.

One day, she receives a notification from Google: "Your account recovery email has been changed."

She didn't change it. Someone else did.

## What Happened

### Step 1: The Email Takeover

The attacker:
1. Went to the Google account recovery page.
2. Entered Ada's email address.
3. Clicked "Forgot password?"
4. Google asked for identity verification (usually: recovery email, recovery phone, or security questions).

The attacker didn't have access to these initially. But they used social engineering:
- Called Google support claiming to be Ada.
- Provided some personal information (found online or from a breach).
- Convinced support to confirm their identity via alternative methods.

Alternatively, the attacker may have:
- Found her recovery email/phone in a data breach.
- Intercepted an SMS or email recovery code through other means (compromised secondary email, etc.).

Regardless, the attacker reset Ada's Gmail password and took control of her email account.

### Step 2: The Cascade of Compromise

With control of Ada's email, the attacker:

1. **Accessed her crypto exchange account** (Binance):
   - Went to Binance's password reset page.
   - Entered Ada's email.
   - Binance sent a password reset link to the email.
   - The attacker received it and reset the password.
   - Binance 2FA: If it was SMS, the attacker could perform a SIM swap. If it was email-based, the attacker already had the email.

2. **Accessed her wallet backup emails** (MetaMask recovery, etc.):
   - Any wallet recovery email codes were intercepted.

3. **Accessed secondary financial accounts** (PayPal, banking apps):
   - All linked to the same email.

4. **Disabled Ada's security options** on her Google account:
   - Removed her phone as a recovery method.
   - Removed alternative emails.
   - Changed the password.
   - Enabled "less secure apps" access.

5. **Drained her crypto holdings:**
   - Using access to her exchange account, the attacker withdrew ₦4.2 million.

Ada lost everything before she even knew her email was compromised.

## Where the Scammer Won

<Warning>
1. **Email as the master key:** A single email account controls access to nearly everything.
2. **Social engineering against Google:** The attacker convinced Google support to reset the account.
3. **Cascading compromise:** Each compromised account led to access of others.
</Warning>

## What Ada Could Have Done (Prevention)

### Email Security (Most Critical)

<Check>**Use a strong, unique password for email.** The email account is the master key; it must be fortress-grade protected.</Check>

<Check>**Enable 2FA on your email** with a hardware security key (Yubikey, Titan) or authenticator app. **Avoid SMS 2FA for email** — it's vulnerable to SIM swaps and social engineering.</Check>

<Check>**Use a secondary, lesser-known email for sensitive accounts.** Create a separate Gmail specifically for crypto/financial accounts, and don't use it for anything else.</Check>

<Check>**Add a recovery email AND phone to your account**, but make sure you control both. Use a second phone number (perhaps a family member's or a business line) as a secondary recovery method.</Check>

<Check>**Set up a Google Account PIN.** Go to myaccount.google.com → Security → Recovery options → Add a PIN. This PIN is required for account changes, making social engineering harder.</Check>

### Account Cascading

<Check>**Never use the same email for multiple high-value accounts.** Use different emails for:
- Personal email (general use)
- Crypto/financial email (separate Gmail, never used for other purposes)
- Work email (if available)</Check>

<Check>**Regularly review account recovery options:**
- On Gmail: myaccount.google.com → Security → How you sign in
- On Binance: Account → API, Security → Security Options
- On any exchange: Account → Recovery Methods</Check>

<Check>**Disable "less secure app access"** on Gmail (if you're not using it).</Check>

## Red Flags Ada Missed

<Warning>
- [ ] **Account recovery email changed without her action.** This is the first sign of compromise.
- [ ] **No alerts on her phone.** She had 2FA on some accounts but not on her email.
