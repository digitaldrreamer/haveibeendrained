## Known Drainer Attack Patterns on Solana

### Attack Vector Taxonomy

**Account Authority Transfer (AAT) Attacks**

Solana's unique account model allows the "Owner" field of any account to be reassigned through on-chain instructions. This creates a critical attack vector that does not exist on Ethereum or other EVM chains. When users sign a malicious transaction containing an "Assign" instruction, their wallet's owner field changes from the System Program to an attacker-controlled program. Once this occurs, the legitimate owner loses all permissions to move or recover assets—even with the correct private key—because the account can no longer act as a signer, fee payer, or authority for any operations.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

This attack is particularly insidious because wallet simulation often shows no visible token transfer when previewing the transaction. Victims believe they are approving routine actions like claiming airdrops, joining allowlists, or enabling staking, but the transaction actually contains hidden authority transfer instructions. In one documented case from late 2025, a victim lost over \$3 million when attackers used this technique to modify wallet owner permissions.[^2][^4][^5][^6]

The technical mechanism involves the `setOwner` or `SetAuthority` instruction, which transfers control of token accounts or wallet accounts to malicious programs. Unlike Ethereum's externally owned accounts (EOAs) that always remain controlled by their private key, Solana accounts can be reassigned, making them vulnerable to permanent hijacking.[^7][^8][^6][^2]

**Single Transaction with Multiple Transfers (STMT)**

This attack leverages Solana's ability to include multiple instructions in a single transaction. Instead of setting up separate transfer transactions for each token type (as required on Ethereum), attackers can drain multiple asset types simultaneously through one malicious transaction containing numerous transfer instructions.[^1]

Research identified 2,438 phishing transactions using this method, with attackers draining four or more different token types plus SOL in single transactions. The most prolific phishing account using this technique (Gck5PWhKL4Qn87bhFwpL19Y5gkAbFN93GXXsTzuJ1VX4) executed 1,639 STMT-based phishing transactions. This method became particularly prevalent in March-April 2024, coinciding with the emergence of Solana-specific drainer tools like Rainbow Drainer and Node Drainer.[^1]

**Approval-Based vs. Ownership Transfer Drains**

The fundamental difference lies in the level of control attackers gain:[^3][^5][^2]

- **Approval-based drains** (similar to EVM chains) involve users signing transactions that grant spending permissions to malicious contracts. The user retains ownership but the attacker can transfer approved tokens.
- **Ownership transfer drains** (unique to Solana) involve changing the actual owner field of accounts, giving attackers complete and permanent control. The victim's private key becomes "cryptographically valid but functionally useless".[^2]

This distinction is critical for detection and recovery. Approval-based attacks can sometimes be revoked, but ownership transfers are irreversible without the cooperation of DeFi protocols that may hold funds.[^6]

**Malicious Browser Extensions**

Browser extensions represent a significant attack vector for intercepting and modifying Solana transactions. The "Crypto Copilot" extension, discovered on the Chrome Web Store, demonstrates this threat:[^9][^10][^11]

- Presented itself as a legitimate Solana trading assistant
- Connected seamlessly with Phantom and Solflare wallets
- Displayed DEX data and supported one-click swaps
- Secretly inserted additional `SystemProgram.transfer` instructions into every Raydium swap transaction
- Diverted 0.0013 SOL or 0.05% of trade value (whichever was higher) to attacker-controlled wallets[^10][^11][^12][^9]

The extension used heavy code obfuscation, hardcoded Solana addresses in transaction logic, and operated for months on the Chrome Web Store without detection. It also exfiltrated wallet public keys and metadata to attacker-controlled servers. The attack worked because wallet pop-up notifications summarized transactions without showing all underlying instructions, allowing the hidden transfer to execute unnoticed.[^11][^9]

A more sophisticated npm supply chain attack compromised the `@solana/web3.js` library (versions 1.95.6 and 1.95.7) in December 2024. Attackers gained publish access through phishing, injected backdoor code to steal private keys, and exfiltrated them via legitimate-looking Cloudflare headers. This five-hour attack window resulted in \$160,000-\$190,000 in stolen crypto assets.[^13][^14][^15][^16]

**Clipboard Hijacking Attacks**

Clipboard hijacking malware detects when users copy cryptocurrency wallet addresses and instantly swaps them with attacker-controlled addresses. On Solana, this attack is integrated into broader malware campaigns:[^17][^18][^19]

- The "Chaos-C++" ransomware includes clipboard hijacking specifically targeting cryptocurrency users[^18]
- Fake Cloudflare services deployed multi-chain crypto clippers capable of intercepting transactions across 20+ blockchain networks including Solana[^17]
- Clipboard data is modified in real-time, so when users paste what they believe is the legitimate recipient address, funds are sent to attackers instead[^18]

The prevalence of clipboard hijacking on Solana mirrors broader cryptocurrency trends, with this technique being a component of larger malware packages rather than a standalone attack vector.[^19][^17]

### Sweeper Bot Patterns

**Timing Characteristics**

Sweeper bots operate with extreme speed, detecting incoming deposits and executing withdrawals within seconds. In the documented "gas-stealing honeypot" pattern, pre-programmed scripts instantly detect when victims send native tokens (SOL) to pay for gas fees and transfer those funds to attacker wallets "within seconds, before the victim can initiate their own transaction".[^20]

While specific millisecond-level timing data for Solana sweeper bots was not found in the research, the general pattern across cryptocurrency platforms shows sweeper bots executing transfers in under 10 seconds from deposit detection. The high-performance nature of Solana's architecture (400ms block times, thousands of TPS) actually facilitates faster sweeper bot operations compared to slower blockchains.[^21][^20]

**Asset Selection Patterns**

Sweeper bots demonstrate sophisticated asset selection strategies rather than indiscriminately draining all tokens:[^22][^23][^1]

- **High-value tokens prioritized**: Stablecoins (USDC, USDT), liquid tokens (SOL, JitoSOL), and high-market-cap assets are targeted first[^6][^1]
- **Token valuation**: Advanced drainer scripts can "approximate the value of digital assets and determine which to steal first"[^24]
- **Selective drainage**: Research shows drainers exchanging various tokens for SOL before moving funds, indicating prioritization of liquid assets[^6]

In the web3.js supply chain attack, the malicious code left "just enough to cover fees" while draining the valuable Solana assets, demonstrating calculated extraction rather than complete wallet emptying.[^25]

**Recipient Address Patterns**

Sweeper bots employ sophisticated fund distribution strategies to obfuscate trails:[^26][^6]

**Multi-level diffusion**: Stolen funds are distributed across multiple intermediary addresses rather than sent to a single destination[^6]

**Address rotation**: The \$3 million Solana phishing attack showed attackers using two core addresses (BaBcXDg… and 7pSj1R…) with further splits to multiple sub-addresses[^6]

**Cross-chain bridging**: Funds are frequently bridged to other chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum) for additional obfuscation[^27][^26][^6]

**DEX interactions**: Immediate conversion of stolen tokens to SOL or stablecoins through decentralized exchanges[^26][^6]

**Mixer usage**: Although specific Solana mixer usage data was limited, cross-chain analysis shows stolen funds flowing to Tornado Cash on Ethereum after bridging[^5][^27]

The \$3 million Solana attack demonstrated this pattern clearly: attackers exchanged various tokens (PAYAI, CASH, CARD'S, JitoSOL, POLYFACTS, PUMP, PYUSD, CAP) for SOL, then used Relay.link to bridge to Ethereum/Arbitrum, followed by multiple 1inch cross-chain swaps to create complex money laundering networks.[^6]

**Distinctive Transaction Signatures**

Several on-chain signatures identify sweeper bot activity:[^28][^5][^6]

1. **Drain-to-zero pattern**: Multiple wallets showing balances collapsing to zero in very short time windows[^28]
2. **Burst detection**: Rapid, high-value withdrawals in short windows (e.g., 80 transfers of \$100,000+ in 15 minutes)[^28]
3. **High-frequency execution**: Dozens of tokens transferred across hundreds of transactions in minutes[^28]
4. **Transaction volume symmetry**: Nearly identical amounts flowing in and out of intermediary accounts to maintain appearance of regular activity[^27]
5. **Timestamp anomalies**: Large numbers of transactions within extremely short periods, indicating automated rather than human activity[^27]

### Recent Major Incidents (2024-2025)

**Slope Wallet Hack (August 2022)**

While technically before the target period, this remains foundational to understanding Solana security:

- **Loss**: \$4.08-\$4.5 million from 9,231 wallets[^29][^30][^31]

**Owner Permission Attacks (Throughout 2024-2025)**

Multiple incidents involving the unique Solana owner modification vulnerability:

- **\$3 million theft (December 2025)**: Victim signed malicious transaction changing wallet owner permissions, lost ~\$3M with additional \$2M locked in DeFi (later recovered)[^4][^5][^6]
- **Rising trend**: SlowMist security firm reported increasing frequency of these attacks throughout 2025[^5][^6]

- **Response**: Bridge suspended, remains inactive pending penetration testing[^34]


### New Attack Patterns (2024-2025)

**Solana-Specific Evolution**

1. **Account Authority Transfer becoming dominant**: Research shows AAT phishing transactions increased significantly in 2024, with 2,171 phishing transactions involving wallet account authority transfers detected. This attack type is "unique to Solana versus EVM chains" because Ethereum EOAs cannot have their ownership reassigned.[^7][^2][^1]
2. **Evolution from ISA → STMT → AAT**: Analysis reveals phishing methods evolved chronologically, with "Impersonation of System Accounts" (ISA) declining, STMT peaking in March-April 2024, and AAT becoming dominant by mid-2024. AAT is "more likely to deceive new Solana users, especially those who do not understand the Solana permission mechanism".[^1]
3. **Delayed transaction execution**: Some phishing programs deploy transactions that do not execute immediately, allowing attackers to avoid detection as funds are not lost right away. This time-delayed approach creates a false sense of security.[^1]
4. **Transaction simulation spoofing**: A new threat emerged where attackers manipulate the simulation layer to show false transaction previews. This represents an evolution beyond simple instruction hiding.[^36]

**Common Phishing Techniques**

Research identified several prevalent social engineering tactics:[^3][^4][^5][^1]

**Fake airdrops**: The most common lure, with scammers creating phishing links disguised as reward claims, airdrops, or community events[^37][^38][^5][^1]

**Address poisoning**: Attackers send minuscule amounts (dust) to create fraudulent addresses in transaction history that closely resemble legitimate recipients[^39][^40]

**Fake staking/DeFi opportunities**: Phishing sites mimic legitimate protocols offering staking rewards or yield farming[^5][^6]

**Compromised social media accounts**: Attackers use stolen accounts from real projects, companies, celebrities, or influencers to distribute phishing links[^41][^37]

**Front-end exploits**: Legitimate websites compromised to inject malicious pop-ups (e.g., Cointelegraph "CTG token" airdrop scam)[^42][^41]

**NFT dusting on Solana**: Unsolicited NFTs sent to wallets containing external links or coded instructions that, when engaged, execute draining contracts[^43]

**Fake browser updates and wallet verification**: Scam sites present bogus updates and request wallet passphrase "validation"[^37]

### Obfuscation Techniques

**Intermediary Wallet Strategies**

Drainers employ sophisticated multi-layer fund movement patterns:[^26][^27][^6]

**Fan-out distribution**: Single source sending funds to multiple destinations to distribute money among different accounts and make tracing difficult[^27]

**Peel chains**: Small, incremental transfers to evade detection[^22]

**Multi-level diffusion**: The \$3 million Solana attack demonstrated funds split across two core addresses, then further distributed to 16+ different addresses through 124+ single transactions[^6][^1]

**Address hopping**: Frequent transfers between intermediary wallets to break heuristics and mimic normal user activity[^44]

**DEX Swap Obfuscation**

Stolen funds are immediately converted to more liquid or fungible assets:[^22][^26][^6]

**Token-to-SOL conversion**: Attackers exchange all stolen tokens (PAYAI, CASH, JitoSOL, PUMP, PYUSD, etc.) to SOL for easier movement[^6]

**Privacy coin swaps**: 60% of stolen Ethereum is swapped to Monero via decentralized exchanges like ChangeNOW; similar patterns likely exist for Solana assets[^22]

**DEX liquidity pool interactions**: Funds circulated through liquidity pools to obscure origins[^44][^26]

**Automated swap scripts**: Drainer malware includes functionality to identify DEX interactions (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap on EVM; Raydium, Orca on Solana) and automatically modify transaction data[^45]

**Cross-Chain Bridging**

Bridges provide powerful obfuscation through chain-hopping:[^46][^26][^27][^22]

**Solana to Ethereum/Arbitrum**: The \$3 million attack used Relay.link to bridge 8,579.92 SOL to Ethereum, then used 1inch for repeated cross-chain operations[^6]

**Multi-chain circulation**: 25% of stolen funds use cross-chain bridges to funnel assets to Bitcoin or other chains for further obfuscation[^22]

**Low-liquidity chain exploitation**: Bridging through high-risk protocols or low-liquidity chains frequently used by scam operators[^44]

**Circular fund movements**: Repeated transfers across newly created wallets on different chains designed to break heuristics[^44]

**Cash-Out Flow Patterns**

Typical laundering flow for stolen Solana funds follows these patterns:[^26][^22][^6]

1. **Initial theft**: Drain wallet via phishing transaction
2. **Immediate conversion**: Exchange all tokens to SOL or stablecoins via DEX
3. **First-layer distribution**: Split funds across 2-5 core intermediary addresses
4. **Cross-chain bridge**: Move significant portions to Ethereum, Arbitrum, or other chains
5. **Multi-chain mixing**: Use 1inch, Relay.link, or similar protocols for repeated cross-chain swaps
6. **Centralized exchange deposits**: Send portions to CEXs for potential fiat off-ramp[^26][^22]
7. **Mixer utilization**: Route through Tornado Cash (Ethereum) or other mixing services[^27][^5][^34]

The \$3 million Solana attack exemplified this: victims' assets moved through two core distribution addresses → DEX swaps to SOL → cross-chain bridges to Ethereum/Arbitrum → multiple 1inch swaps → CEX deposits and mixer usage, creating "multi-level, cross-ecosystem money laundering network that greatly increases the difficulty of tracking".[^6]

**Advanced Obfuscation Techniques**

**Scam clustering**: Fund consolidation into small sets of operational wallets, followed by quick exits through mixers, bridges, or liquidity pools[^44]

**Wash trading patterns**: Abnormal velocity patterns with rapid inflows of small payments consistent with drainer sweeps[^44]

**Premium fee spending**: Stolen fund actors consistently pay 2.58x to 14.5x premiums over standard transaction costs to prioritize speed and finality over cost optimization[^26]

**Time-delayed dispersal**: Some attackers "HODL" stolen funds on-chain rather than immediately laundering, potentially reflecting confidence in operational security[^26]

**Known Drainer Addresses**

While comprehensive public registries of drainer addresses remain limited, research identified several specific malicious accounts and patterns:

**Documented Phishing Programs**:

- `GKJBELftW5Rjg24wP88NRaKGsEBtrPLgMiv3DhbJwbzQ`: Received authority transfers in the \$3M attack[^6]
- `BNRT…5Rep` (BNRThTYg9x49JYNkbDUYERb3X7JV2GYcEpFLAUHX5Rep): Largest volume phishing program with 931 AAT transactions[^1]
- `Gck5…1VX4` (Gck5PWhKL4Qn87bhFwpL19Y5gkAbFN93GXXsTzuJ1VX4): Most prolific STMT phisher with 1,639 transactions[^1]

**Intermediary Addresses from Major Incidents**:

- `BaBcXDg…` and `7pSj1R…`: Core distribution addresses in \$3M attack[^6]
- `FiywJZ2Z…`: Received 5,742 SOL plus 2,772.8 SOL from another marked phishing address[^6]
- `fgR5PJF…`: Used for DeFi asset rescue in \$3M incident[^6]

**Limited Public Tracking**: Research found that "only 10.8% of DaaS-related addresses" in academic datasets were previously flagged on public trackers like Etherscan, indicating vast blind spots in current detection.[^47]

### Red Flags for Malicious Transactions

**Transaction-Level Red Flags**

1. **Authority/Owner modification instructions**: Any transaction containing `Assign`, `SetAuthority`, or similar owner-changing instructions should be rejected immediately[^48][^2][^5][^6]
2. **Multiple transfer instructions in single transaction**: Legitimate applications rarely need to transfer 4+ different token types simultaneously[^1]
3. **Hidden or unclear instructions**: Wallet simulations showing "no change in funds" when transaction actually contains instructions[^5][^6]
4. **Unrecognized program invocations**: Transactions calling programs you haven't explicitly intended to interact with[^49][^48]
5. **Token account authority transfers**: Instructions that modify token account ownership rather than simply transferring tokens[^8][^1]

**Pre-Signature Warning Signs**

**Urgency and pressure**: Requests demanding immediate action, countdown timers, or "limited time" claims[^50][^48][^37]

**Seed phrase requests**: Legitimate applications never ask for seed phrases or private keys[^38][^48][^50]

**Suspicious URLs**: Typosquatting (slight misspellings), homoglyph swapping (similar-looking characters), unexpected domains[^51][^38][^37]

**Unverified sources**: Airdrops or claims not announced through official project channels[^52][^38][^50]

**Gas fee requests for "free" tokens**: Legitimate airdrops don't require upfront payments[^50]

**Poor presentation quality**: Spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, unprofessional images[^48][^37]

**Wallet Connection Risks**

**Unknown dApps**: Connecting main wallets to unverified decentralized applications[^53][^54][^5]

**Approval scope**: Requests for "unlimited spend approval" or vague permission grants[^55][^51]

**Missing transaction details**: Wallet interfaces showing only summary information without full instruction breakdowns[^9][^10][^55]

**Unverifiable smart contracts**: Contracts without public audits from reputable security firms[^56][^57][^51]

**On-Chain Behavior Red Flags**

**Unlocked liquidity**: Token projects where liquidity pools aren't locked or are controlled by single wallets[^58][^56]

**Concentrated token holdings**: Large percentages held by development team or few wallets[^57][^56]

**Suspicious trading patterns**: Unusual spikes, extremely low liquidity, or wash trading indicators[^56][^57]

**Missing freeze/mint authority renunciation**: On Solana, if freeze or mint authority remains under developer control, they can lock holders' balances or mint unlimited tokens[^58]

**Developer Control Functions**: Smart contracts containing functions like `selfDestruct()`, `setOwner()`, or similar administrative privileges that could drain liquidity[^51][^49]

### Implementation Guidance for "Have I Been Drained"

**Detection Algorithm Priorities**

Based on the research, the detection system should prioritize:

1. **AAT Detection (Highest Priority)**: Scan for `Assign` and `SetAuthority` instructions in transaction history, as these indicate permanent compromise[^2][^5][^1]
2. **STMT Pattern Recognition**: Identify single transactions with 4+ transfer instructions across different token types[^1]
3. **Timing Analysis**: Flag transactions where multiple high-value withdrawals occurred within seconds of each other[^20][^28]
4. **Balance Drain Patterns**: Detect accounts that went from substantial balance to near-zero in single or few transactions[^28]

**Classification Approach**

**Severity Levels**:

- **Critical**: Authority transfers, complete wallet drainage, private key compromise indicators
- **High**: Multiple token drains in single transaction, participation in known drainer campaigns
- **Medium**: Single token unauthorized transfers, approval-based drains
- **Low**: Dusting attacks, address poisoning attempts

**Attack Type Classification**:

- Authority Transfer Drain (AAT)
- Single Transaction Multiple Transfer (STMT)
- Approval-Based Drain
- Private Key Compromise (if all assets drained including SOL for fees)
- Supply Chain Attack (if web3.js or similar library compromise timing matches)

**Recovery Guidance Framework**

Based on attack type, provide specific guidance:

**For AAT attacks**:

- Immediate notification that wallet is permanently compromised
- Guidance to contact DeFi protocols where funds may be locked (as \$2M was recovered in documented case)[^6]
- Create new wallet immediately; do not reuse compromised address

**For STMT/Approval drains**:

- Check for any remaining assets
- Revoke all token approvals using Solana equivalents of Revoke.Cash
- Transfer remaining assets to new wallet

**For active drains**:

- Immediate fund freeze guidance if CEX deposits detected
- Contact exchanges where funds were sent
- Law enforcement reporting procedures

**Community Reporting System Design**

**Anti-Spam Mechanisms**:

- Require wallet signatures to prove ownership of reported address
- Implement reputation scoring for reporters
- Cross-reference reports with on-chain data to verify claims
- Rate limiting per wallet/IP address
- Require minimum account age or activity for report submission

**Verification Tiers**:

- **Automated verification**: On-chain pattern matching confirms attack signatures
- **Community consensus**: Multiple independent reports of same address
- **Security firm confirmation**: Integration with SlowMist, MistTrack, or similar services
- **Official confirmation**: Verified by project teams or security auditors

**Cost Considerations**

**Free Options (Recommended for MVP)**:

- **Helius RPC**: Free tier provides substantial transaction lookup capacity[^12]
- **Public Solana RPC nodes**: No cost but rate limited
- **Solscan API**: Free tier for basic transaction and account lookups[^56]
- **Solana FM**: Free blockchain explorer with API access
- **Anchor framework**: Open-source for on-chain registry development

**Paid Services (For Scale)**:

- **Helius Premium**: Enhanced RPC performance, webhooks for real-time monitoring (~\$50-500/month depending on scale)
- **QuickNode**: Solana RPC infrastructure (~\$50-300/month)
- **Cloudflare R2**: Storage for drainer registry data (very low cost, ~\$0.015/GB)
- **PostgreSQL hosting**: Render, Railway, or Supabase free tiers initially; paid plans ~\$5-25/month

**Research Sources**:

- Academic papers (free): SolPhishHunter research, drainer-as-a-service studies
- Security firm intelligence: MistTrack, SlowMist reports (some free, some require partnership)
- Community intelligence: Solana Discord, security-focused Telegram channels (free)


### Technical Resources

**Libraries and Tools**:

- `@solana/web3.js`: Core JavaScript SDK (ensure version 1.95.8+)[^13][^16]
- `@coral-xyz/anchor`: Framework for Solana program development
- `@solana/spl-token`: Token program interactions
- **Solana Explorer API**: Free transaction and account data access
- **Metaplex SDK**: For NFT-related attack detection
- **Helius SDK**: Enhanced transaction parsing and webhooks

**Best Practices**:

- **Rate limiting**: Implement caching layers to reduce RPC calls
- **Batch requests**: Use `getMultipleAccounts` instead of individual lookups
- **Webhook usage**: For real-time monitoring, use Helius webhooks rather than polling
- **Data caching**: Cache known drainer addresses and attack patterns locally
- **PostgreSQL indexes**: Properly index wallet addresses and transaction signatures for fast lookups

**Common Pitfalls**:

- **RPC rate limiting**: Free tier RPC nodes will throttle; implement exponential backoff
- **Transaction parsing complexity**: Solana transactions can contain complex instruction nesting; use libraries rather than manual parsing
- **Versioned transactions**: Ensure code handles both legacy and v0 (Address Lookup Table) transactions
- **Partial transaction data**: Not all RPC nodes provide full historical data; may need specialized archival nodes
- **False positives**: Multi-signature wallets and DeFi protocols naturally have complex transaction patterns that can mimic attacks

This comprehensive analysis provides the foundation for building a robust Solana drain detection system, incorporating the latest attack patterns identified through December 2025 and leveraging both free and cost-effective paid services where necessary.
