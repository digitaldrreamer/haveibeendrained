# \#\# 5. Existing Drainer Address Databases and Threat Intelligence

### Research Questions

**Public Databases:**

- Does Chainabuse.com have a Solana scam database? Is there an API or bulk export?
- What is Scam Sniffer's coverage of Solana versus EVM chains?
- Does CertiK's SkyNet track Solana drainers? How can data be accessed?
- Are there any Solana-specific scam databases or registries?

**Wallet Provider Blocklists:**

- Do Phantom, Solflare, or Backpack maintain public blocklists of malicious addresses?
- Are these blocklists accessible via API or downloadable?
- How frequently are they updated?

**Blockchain Analytics:**

- Do Chainalysis, Elliptic, or TRM Labs offer Solana threat intelligence?
- What is the pricing for accessing their data?
- Do they provide real-time feeds or batch exports?

**Community Sources:**

- What are the most active Solana security Twitter accounts or Discord servers?
- Are there any community-maintained lists of known drainers?
- What is the format and reliability of community-reported data?

**RPC Provider Features:**

- Does Helius offer address reputation scoring or blocklists?
- Do other RPC providers (QuickNode, Alchemy) offer similar features?


### Desired Outputs

- List of all available drainer address sources with access methods
- Comparison of data quality and update frequency
- Scraper implementation guidance for each source
- Estimated total number of known Solana drainer addresses
- Data format specifications for each source

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive research document. Let me provide a summary of the key findings:

## Summary: Existing Drainer Address Databases and Threat Intelligence

I've compiled a **comprehensive research guide** covering all available Solana drainer detection sources for your "Have I Been Drained" project. Here are the critical findings:

### **1. Key Data Sources (Ranked by Usefulness)**

| Source | Coverage | Access | Cost | Quality |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Chainabuse API** | ✅ Solana | ✅ API | Custom | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Community Reports** | ✅ Solana | ✅ Free | \$0 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Helius RPC** | ✅ Analysis | ✅ Free tier | \$0 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Solsniffer** | ⚠️ Tokens only | ✅ API | \$47+/mo | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **CertiK** | ✅ Research | ✅ Web | Free | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Chainalysis** | ✅ Enterprise | ❌ Not for startups | \$50K+ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

### **2. Critical Findings**

✅ **NO single open Solana drainer database exists** - This is your competitive opportunity!

✅ **Chainabuse** is the best available API:

- Free platform for community reports
- Paid API for bulk screening
- Highest institutional credibility (TRM Labs)

⚠️ **Wallet provider blocklists are private:**

- Phantom, Solflare, Backpack won't share data
- No public API access
- Strategy: Build your own aggregated blocklist

✅ **Community sources are rich but scattered:**

- Twitter/X security accounts
- Reddit r/solana scam reports
- Discord security communities
- Requires aggregation + validation


### **3. Recommended Implementation Strategy**

**Layer 1 (Primary):** Chainabuse API (negotiate deal for startup)
**Layer 2 (Secondary):** Community reports (Twitter, Reddit, Discord)
**Layer 3 (Tertiary):** Pattern analysis (Helius RPC for behavioral detection)
**Layer 4 (Validation):** Cross-reference requiring 3+ sources for "HIGH" confidence

### **4. Cost Breakdown**

- **MVP Phase:** ~\$0-5/month (use free Chainabuse + community sources)
- **Growth Phase:** ~\$50-200/month (Chainabuse API + upgraded services)
- **Enterprise Scale:** ~\$1K+/month (dedicated infrastructure)


### **5. Competitive Advantage**

Your project is uniquely positioned to:

- Build the **first public, unified Solana drainer registry** (massive gap)
- Use **free/affordable sources** (unlike Chainalysis \$50K+ model)
- Serve **retail users** (existing tools are enterprise-only)
- Create **Solana-specific depth** (competitors are multi-chain)

**Estimated Known Drainer Addresses:** 300-2,000+ wallets exist; you can aggregate them into the most comprehensive public database.

The full document is saved and ready for your implementation team—includes pseudocode for data pipelines, PostgreSQL schema, anti-spam strategies, and phased rollout plan! 🚀
