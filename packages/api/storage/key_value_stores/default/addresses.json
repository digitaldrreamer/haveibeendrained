MÉTODO UTILIZADO PELO CRIMINOSOO crime foi executado através de técnica de phishing utilizando uma extensão falsa de navegador:1. O criminoso criou ou utilizou uma extensão maliciosa para o navegador Google Chrome que se passava pelo aplicativo legítimo \"Solflare Wallet\".2. A vítima instalou a extensão acreditando ser o software oficial da Solflare.3. Ao importar a carteira de criptomoedas utilizando a frase de recuperação (seed phrase) de 12/24 palavras, a extensão maliciosa capturou e enviou essas informações ao criminoso.4. De posse da seed phrase, o criminoso obteve controle total sobre a carteira da vítima.5. Em menos de 5 minutos após a importação, o criminoso executou múltiplas transações transferindo todos os ativos para sua própria carteira.6. O criminoso primeiro fechou as posições alavancadas da vítima na plataforma Jupiter Perps para liberar o colateral, e então transferiu todos os fundos.7. DESCRIÇÃO DOS FATOS (PARA O B.O.)No dia 02 de dezembro de 2025, por volta das 08:53 (horário de Brasília), fui vítima de crime cibernético envolvendo roubo de criptomoedas. Instalei uma extensão de navegador Google Chrome que se passava pelo aplicativo legítimo \"Solflare Wallet\", uma carteira digital para a blockchain Solana. Ao importar minha carteira de criptomoedas utilizando a frase de recuperação (seed phrase), criminosos obtiveram acesso às minhas credenciais. Minutos após a importação, transações não autorizadas foram realizadas a partir da minha carteira, resultando no roubo de aproximadamente US$ 4.682,00 (quatro mil seiscentos e oitenta e dois dólares americanos), equivalente a aproximadamente R$ 25.000,00 (vinte e cinco mil reais). Todas as transações podem ser verificadas publicamente na blockchain Solana através do explorador Solscan.io.

MÉTODO UTILIZADO PELO CRIMINOSO\n\nO crime foi executado através de técnica de phishing utilizando uma extensão falsa de navegador:\n\n1. O criminoso criou ou utilizou uma extensão maliciosa para o navegador Google Chrome que se passava pelo aplicativo legítimo \"Solflare Wallet\".\n\n2. A vítima instalou a extensão acreditando ser o software oficial da Solflare.\n\n3. Ao importar a carteira de criptomoedas utilizando a frase de recuperação (seed phrase) de 12/24 palavras, a extensão maliciosa capturou e enviou essas informações ao criminoso.\n\n4. De posse da seed phrase, o criminoso obteve controle total sobre a carteira da vítima.\n\n5. Em menos de 5 minutos após a importação, o criminoso executou múltiplas transações transferindo todos os ativos para sua própria carteira.\n\n6. O criminoso primeiro fechou as posições alavancadas da vítima na plataforma Jupiter Perps para liberar o colateral, e então transferiu todos os fundos.\n\n7. DESCRIÇÃO DOS FATOS (PARA O B.O.)\n\nNo dia 02 de dezembro de 2025, por volta das 08:53 (horário de Brasília), fui vítima de crime cibernético envolvendo roubo de criptomoedas. Instalei uma extensão de navegador Google Chrome que se passava pelo aplicativo legítimo \"Solflare Wallet\", uma carteira digital para a blockchain Solana. Ao importar minha carteira de criptomoedas utilizando a frase de recuperação (seed phrase), criminosos obtiveram acesso às minhas credenciais. Minutos após a importação, transações não autorizadas foram realizadas a partir da minha carteira, resultando no roubo de aproximadamente US$ 4.682,00 (quatro mil seiscentos e oitenta e dois dólares americanos), equivalente a aproximadamente R$ 25.000,00 (vinte e cinco mil reais). Todas as transações podem ser verificadas publicamente na blockchain Solana através do explorador Solscan.io. Apresento os endereços de carteira envolvidos e as assinaturas das transações fraudulentas como prova do ocorrido.\n\n8.

        "description": "I'm a crypto novice. I bought some Ace Data Cloud coin ($ACE) and recently they announced a migration of the coin so I joined their discord channel to find out if there was anything special I needed to do to secure my coin for the migration since I'm not really knowledgeable in crypto processes and I didn't want to lose it.Someone in the discord that goes by Naji408 said \"You will when the window opens\". A 2-3 seconds later a discord support ticket window opens and I joined it. I assumed this was the window Naji408 meant. (I've since talked with Naji408 after being robbed and he's explained that is not what he meant. He meant the window in time when the migration takes place in the near future.)Someone else in the discord, Kuroshio7908, added me as a friend and I accepted the friend request. In the ACE server he was in the \"waiting room\" tab which is locked and requires a code to enter, I assumed he was someone official in the server. After joining the support ticket Kuroshio7908 was in both the ACE and support ticket servers with me.The discord support ticket I joined appears to be a separate and different server than the ACE coin discord server. I don't use discord often so I'm not certain. It may be a fake support ticket or something that lured me away from the ACE discord into a scammer's discord disguised as a support ticket.There I spoke with an \"Admin\" who said I had to whitelist my coin and instructed me to go to a website (serterix.com - do not use this, you will get robbed) and connect my wallet. When you try to connect your wallet, the website pretends to have trouble connecting and prompts you to connect manually. It gives you 3 options, Json, private key, or your seed phrase/secret recovery phrase.Red flags and alarm bells go off. It looked suspicious so I googled it real quick and I couldn't find anything to really authenticate it, but I couldn't find anything saying it was a scam either. I voiced my concern to the Admin in the support ticket, they said it was legit. I believed them and chose to use my private key. (I knew the seed phrase should never be shared but I wasn't aware so much of the private key, I thought it was needed to verify my coin, I was wrong.) This time it gave me a checkmark, but nothing happened. There was no next step to whitelist my ACE coin. Refresh the page, same connect sign, and again, nothing.I let the Admin know it's not doing anything, he asks which option I chose, I told him private key, he said try the seed phrase. Now the alarm bells are getting louder. I google the website I just gave my private key to. I find one random review on a different site (www.trustpilot.com). It says someone used it to scam them. I foolishly let the Admin know that I think it's a scam. (What I should have done is immediately transfer my coin to a different wallet)After I tell him I think it's a scam he gives me a link to some fake white papers to show that it's not a scam. It's 2 pages, obviously fake, but does it's job distracting me long enough for them to empty my wallet. Now I'm pissed.I go back to the ACE discord, it's been about a half hour since I joined the support ticket, no activity since Naji408 said \"you will when the window opens\", no elaboration or explanation what \"the window\" means. I start sounding the alarm, saying I've been robbed. I post a screenshot of the website review in the discord. I then get banned with no warning. Next I'm on the coin's twitter page warning people and looking for Naji408 and Kuroshio7908.Eventually I find Naji408, not long after I find him we talk, he denies any involvement. He explains \"the window\" meant a time window in the future during the migration process. He admits he's the one who banned me, he explains he did it because I posted a screen shot and he thought it was soliciting or something and he was just doing what he was typically told to do in that scenario. He says he has no idea who Kuroshio7908 is. He seems honest, however I can't confirm or deny whether he sent the support ticket window or not.Kuroshio7908 vanished from both servers. Naji408 was never in the support ticket server and is still in the ACE server being helpful to anyone with questions and he's continued to work with me to solve this after I called him a thief. I think Naji's innocent, but I don't know for certain.\n\nI'm a crypto novice.

I made total of 5,6 $SOL from October until recently. 2 transacions from MEXC 0.5 SOL and 1 SOL, and 2 transactions from Phantom wallet, once 2 SOL and second 2.1 SOL. I have received all $CR7 in Phantom wallet, on MEXC still did not (they said it will be after listing if ever listed on MEXC). After last transaction, things get weird in community channel. No news, no engagements. Silence for few days. And after one normal sentence on telegram group, I was kicked out, support deleted all history that I made with them in chat. Then I went again investigating everything and found out that every single SOL entering main wallet was pulled out almost immediately to other newly created accounts which can bee seen on solscan I have provided. Plus, there were several launch postpones already. Counter for sold CR7 on their site went from 99% to 76%, than on 92% recently.

But on X you can see that launch date is November 30 2025 and this is 3rd time they postponed. Also you can see that they are braging about Binance. I have also sent query to Binance support to see what they will say. I think it is just scam so more poor souls gave them money (SOL) for nothing.

There wasn't any big investments lately so this also doesn't makes any sense.\n\nSOLSCAN: https://solscan.io/account/DrgxvHQb9DzgBG5YkP8FyeFAbJp2M54XTzuubt3QfDZP#transfersMY OTHER TXID's that are not accepted in filed above:\n\nxuXquLBzQTpQaX4GwF2nfsSqSLCq25PMWrjv4XgzVhrHy9NHmjx3NodUgsKSt9zwnyoB4FMWbcsamySeD17msQ3K77dhWQz4L6romepC8tHoCLAxnqne91rbuVXGhJYgaC9eaVvfFKk1mPJDJ64Z2XiYKX2FuME62LJyoyZFoLgyRn\n\nI have attached screenshots from their X page but there isn't a lot information , most of it is in telegram group that I can't retrive now. But on X you can see that launch date is November 30 2025 and this is 3rd time they postponed. Also you can see that they are braging about Binance. I have also sent query to Binance support to see what they will say. I think it is just scam so more poor souls gave them money (SOL) for nothing. Also there are few screenshots from my transaction from their page. All communication is Telegram based!\n\nAmount lost\n\n1000.00 USD\n\nThe following sites have been reported by users as potentially fraudulent.

They persuaded me to transfer funds in cryptocurrency as part of the “onboarding/payment” / deposit process described by the scammers.Financial transfers and losses (breakdown):\n\nBityBank — USD 14,751.79\n\nCrypto — USD 24.401,13\n\nMercado Bitcoin — USD 5,403.33\n\nFunds initially deposited into the wallets above were later routed to accounts on exchanges (which I have identified during my own investigation). The primary receiving exchanges/accounts where funds ended up are: BityBank, Crypto, and Mercado Bitcoin (values listed above). I have found associated accounts on LBank that received funds originating from Destination address:\n\n1) Trou4EavgzEMoBp3V93LNaaiKY3Y3Rg5Cx\n\n2) TeqiXhjxBXenG3wvA2YiyDwJTuw6jeioer\n\nOther relevant details / indicators:My initial support request to LBank was registered under ticket number W4VFPN, but since I am not a direct customer of LBank, I was informed that no assistance could be provided. However.\n\nI am now seeking your collaboration with law enforcement for the formal investigation that has been opened in Brazil (Police Report No. PP8152-1/2025).\n\nThe fraudulent webpages are impersonating a legitimate recruiting/job listing appearance and were hosted on platforms/services with infrastructure in the United States.\n\nScammers used messaging apps (WhatsApp and Telegram) to guide me through conversion of my funds into crypto and to provide transaction instructions.\n\nI possess screenshots of the web pages, chat histories, wallet addresses, and transaction confirmations. I also have the on-chain links above confirming movement of tokens from the deposit addresses to the destination wallets/exchanges.\n\nAmount lost\n\n44556.25 USD\n\nThe following sites have been reported by users as potentially fraudulent.

She said she works with people over the world who use the platform Coinxax and they provide me with the amount to trade and when to execute. I started with $800 and with the promising returns i invested more until I was up to 38k plus in funds. My account grew to over $127,000 in total funds with \"fake Profits\". When I wanted to remove funds I was given one withdrawal of 5k and after that everything was blocked. I was then told by Keith that I could either pay an up front 25k to have my funds released that day or wait 6 months. I asked her for the funds and of course she denied me.

Followed that group via WhatsApp.  There they initially provided stock market training and offered profitable trades.  These all worked out great.  Communication was either in the training group through WhatsApp or through Emily via Telegram.  These trades were made through our own brokerage accounts.  (I'm assuming to gain our trust that they knew what they were doing.)The group's founder, \"Walter Cross\" and his technologists were building an AI capable of making stock picks based on taking in all kinds of market news and statistics.  This is the Darvis Intelligent Analysis System.Eventually, they wanted some beta testers to do crypto futures trading.  We signed up for an account on an exchange called RapidBitEx, which was a phone app (came to find out later there was also apparently a web version).  The app is called Rapidbt and apparently is no longer available in the app store.  I'll call this the 'platform'.The test accounts were loaded with $100K and that was used for the simulated crypto futures trades.After the testing, they declared the system stable enough that we could open our own accounts on that exchange.  I did so and funded the account with $2500 worth of ETH from Coinbase (minus fees etc).  Trades went well and I added more to the account - I added two instances of $10K.  Then I added $467K from Coinbase.  I also made a wire transfer of $500K that was deposited to my account on the platform.  I was able to trade that account up to $2.3M at which time I supposedly executed a trade wrong and the account was liquidated.  Lost that entire amount.I regrouped and was able to wire in another $250K to start over.  After a few days, it was offered that I could borrow from a P2P provider associated with the platform.  I 'borrowed' $250K.  From that $500K, I grew the account to $5.7M.Then the P2P loan service called my loan due and 'froze' my account until it was repaid.  I made an agreement with them that if I paid half (which included interest) they would request to have my account unfrozen whereby I would pay them the balance out of funds in my account.  This was $136500.  My account was opened but then it seemed the platform had detected some possible fraud with my account and had to do a security investigation during which time I wasn't able to move any money.  This meant I couldn't pay off my balance within the given time frame and P2P loan again froze my account.At this point, they told me if I didn't pay the balance they would take over my account.  It was somewhere between paying them the 1/2 and the refreezing of my account I decided it was a scam and basically quit contact.

(I'm assuming to gain our trust that they knew what they were doing.)\n\nThe group's founder, \"Walter Cross\" and his technologists were building an AI capable of making stock picks based on taking in all kinds of market news and statistics.  This is the Darvis Intelligent Analysis System.\n\nEventually, they wanted some beta testers to do crypto futures trading.  We signed up for an account on an exchange called RapidBitEx, which was a phone app (came to find out later there was also apparently a web version).  The app is called Rapidbt and apparently is no longer available in the app store.  I'll call this the 'platform'.\n\nThe test accounts were loaded with $100K and that was used for the simulated crypto futures trades.\n\nAfter the testing, they declared the system stable enough that we could open our own accounts on that exchange.  I did so and funded the account with $2500 worth of ETH from Coinbase (minus fees etc).  Trades went well and I added more to the account - I added two instances of $10K.  Then I added $467K from Coinbase.  I also made a wire transfer of $500K that was deposited to my account on the platform.  I was able to trade that account up to $2.3M at which time I supposedly executed a trade wrong and the account was liquidated.  Lost that entire amount.\n\nI regrouped and was able to wire in another $250K to start over.  After a few days, it was offered that I could borrow from a P2P provider associated with the platform.  I 'borrowed' $250K.  From that $500K, I grew the account to $5.7M.\n\nThen the P2P loan service called my loan due and 'froze' my account until it was repaid.  I made an agreement with them that if I paid half (which included interest) they would request to have my account unfrozen whereby I would pay them the balance out of funds in my account.  This was $136500.  My account was opened but then it seemed the platform had detected some possible fraud with my account and had to do a security investigation during which time I wasn't able to move any money.  This meant I couldn't pay off my balance within the given time frame and P2P loan again froze my account.\n\nAt this point, they told me if I didn't pay the balance they would take over my account.  It was somewhere between paying them the 1/2 and the refreezing of my account I decided it was a scam and basically quit contact.\n\nI can't access my account anymore, though I am still a member of the active WhatsApp group.\n\nAmount lost\n\n1319791.00 USD",

But today I just happen to open my phantom wallet on November 4, 2025, and I see the balance is zero, I quickly see the transactions. I've kept some Solana and converted other remaining in USDT. There were two transections first was of converting my USDT to Solana and other was all my Solana was transfer to another wallet. The transaction was made on October 30, 2025. I haven't touched my wallet in like 6 months and the recovery phase is also in secure place. I don't know how they gain access to my wallet and did this robbery. I did have my wallet extension on my web browser so maybe they get to my browser and to my saved password/information. even though it's not a big amount for some but it was my savings Afterall. I'm no expert in tech world and I have faced this scam First time, so I'm somewhat freaked out. I hope this scammer/hacker caught fast ASAP. No one should face what I'm Going through. Stay safe and be aware these guys need tiny window to get to your device and wipe you off. Peace.\n\nNormally I don't open my wallet, so I just kept my crypto hoping one day it would go up!
