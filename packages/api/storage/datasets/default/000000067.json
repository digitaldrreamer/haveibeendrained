I was given fake bank statement and drivers license. after a few weeks talk began about investing in crypto when I asked her how she had so much cash. She said she works with people over the world who use the platform Coinxax and they provide me with the amount to trade and when to execute. I started with $800 and with the promising returns i invested more until I was up to 38k plus in funds. My account grew to over $127,000 in total funds with \"fake Profits\". When I wanted to remove funds I was given one withdrawal of 5k and after that everything was blocked. I was then told by Keith that I could either pay an up front 25k to have my funds released that day or wait 6 months. I asked her for the funds and of course she denied me. I then went to the local police dept who would not let me file a report saying I had to wait 6 months but they did check the driver's license which they told me was fake.  I am devestated. I filed with IC3\n\nThis woman reached out pretending to want to purchase a home.
