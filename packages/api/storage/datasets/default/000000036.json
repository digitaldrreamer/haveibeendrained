	"description": "I'm a crypto novice. I bought some Ace Data Cloud coin ($ACE) and recently they announced a migration of the coin so I joined their discord channel to find out if there was anything special I needed to do to secure my coin for the migration since I'm not really knowledgeable in crypto processes and I didn't want to lose it.Someone in the discord that goes by Naji408 said \"You will when the window opens\". A 2-3 seconds later a discord support ticket window opens and I joined it. I assumed this was the window Naji408 meant. (I've since talked with Naji408 after being robbed and he's explained that is not what he meant. He meant the window in time when the migration takes place in the near future.)Someone else in the discord, Kuroshio7908, added me as a friend and I accepted the friend request. In the ACE server he was in the \"waiting room\" tab which is locked and requires a code to enter, I assumed he was someone official in the server. After joining the support ticket Kuroshio7908 was in both the ACE and support ticket servers with me.The discord support ticket I joined appears to be a separate and different server than the ACE coin discord server. I don't use discord often so I'm not certain. It may be a fake support ticket or something that lured me away from the ACE discord into a scammer's discord disguised as a support ticket.There I spoke with an \"Admin\" who said I had to whitelist my coin and instructed me to go to a website (serterix.com - do not use this, you will get robbed) and connect my wallet. When you try to connect your wallet, the website pretends to have trouble connecting and prompts you to connect manually. It gives you 3 options, Json, private key, or your seed phrase/secret recovery phrase.Red flags and alarm bells go off. It looked suspicious so I googled it real quick and I couldn't find anything to really authenticate it, but I couldn't find anything saying it was a scam either. I voiced my concern to the Admin in the support ticket, they said it was legit. I believed them and chose to use my private key. (I knew the seed phrase should never be shared but I wasn't aware so much of the private key, I thought it was needed to verify my coin, I was wrong.) This time it gave me a checkmark, but nothing happened. There was no next step to whitelist my ACE coin. Refresh the page, same connect sign, and again, nothing.I let the Admin know it's not doing anything, he asks which option I chose, I told him private key, he said try the seed phrase. Now the alarm bells are getting louder. I google the website I just gave my private key to. I find one random review on a different site (www.trustpilot.com). It says someone used it to scam them. I foolishly let the Admin know that I think it's a scam. (What I should have done is immediately transfer my coin to a different wallet)After I tell him I think it's a scam he gives me a link to some fake white papers to show that it's not a scam. It's 2 pages, obviously fake, but does it's job distracting me long enough for them to empty my wallet. Now I'm pissed.I go back to the ACE discord, it's been about a half hour since I joined the support ticket, no activity since Naji408 said \"you will when the window opens\", no elaboration or explanation what \"the window\" means. I start sounding the alarm, saying I've been robbed. I post a screenshot of the website review in the discord. I then get banned with no warning. Next I'm on the coin's twitter page warning people and looking for Naji408 and Kuroshio7908.Eventually I find Naji408, not long after I find him we talk, he denies any involvement. He explains \"the window\" meant a time window in the future during the migration process. He admits he's the one who banned me, he explains he did it because I posted a screen shot and he thought it was soliciting or something and he was just doing what he was typically told to do in that scenario. He says he has no idea who Kuroshio7908 is. He seems honest, however I can't confirm or deny whether he sent the support ticket window or not.Kuroshio7908 vanished from both servers. Naji408 was never in the support ticket server and is still in the ACE server being helpful to anyone with questions and he's continued to work with me to solve this after I called him a thief. I think Naji's innocent, but I don't know for certain.\n\nI'm a crypto novice.
