Over the course of several months, he persuaded me to transfer funds totaling $405,000.00 to a Coinbase account for the benefit of my special needs daughter.  He instructed the purchase of Solana crypto in three separate transactions, and I sent each purchase to what I believed to be my trading account. The crypto was in fact, sent to his account.  I initiated trading transactions on what I believe was my account on 9/27/25 and 10/10/25.\n\nI met Martin S. on LinkedIn in July 2025.
