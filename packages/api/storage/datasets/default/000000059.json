	"description": "From October 24 I have made several transaction in order to buy $CR7 token on presale. Everything looked good. Web page, marketing, community on Telegram and on X. I have checked everything I could before making transfers. On their web page, 1 $SOL = 7000 $CR7 tokens. I made total of 5,6 $SOL from October until recently. 2 transacions from MEXC 0.5 SOL and 1 SOL, and 2 transactions from Phantom wallet, once 2 SOL and second 2.1 SOL. I have received all $CR7 in Phantom wallet, on MEXC still did not (they said it will be after listing if ever listed on MEXC). After last transaction, things get weird in community channel. No news, no engagements. Silence for few days. And after one normal sentence on telegram group, I was kicked out, support deleted all history that I made with them in chat. Then I went again investigating everything and found out that every single SOL entering main wallet was pulled out almost immediately to other newly created accounts which can bee seen on solscan I have provided. Plus, there were several launch postpones already. Counter for sold CR7 on their site went from 99% to 76%, than on 92% recently. There wasn't any big investments lately so this also doesn't makes any sense.

But on X you can see that launch date is November 30 2025 and this is 3rd time they postponed. Also you can see that they are braging about Binance. I have also sent query to Binance support to see what they will say. I think it is just scam so more poor souls gave them money (SOL) for nothing. Also there are few screenshots from my transaction from their page. All communication is Telegram based!\n\nFrom October 24 I have made several transaction in order to buy $CR7 token on presale.
