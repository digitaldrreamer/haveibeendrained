	"description": "After reading about this, typical pig-butchering scam.  I answered a Facebook ad, made contact with \"Emily\" who connected me with the Winchester Community.  Followed that group via WhatsApp.  There they initially provided stock market training and offered profitable trades.  These all worked out great.  Communication was either in the training group through WhatsApp or through Emily via Telegram.  These trades were made through our own brokerage accounts.  (I'm assuming to gain our trust that they knew what they were doing.)The group's founder, \"Walter Cross\" and his technologists were building an AI capable of making stock picks based on taking in all kinds of market news and statistics.  This is the Darvis Intelligent Analysis System.Eventually, they wanted some beta testers to do crypto futures trading.  We signed up for an account on an exchange called RapidBitEx, which was a phone app (came to find out later there was also apparently a web version).  The app is called Rapidbt and apparently is no longer available in the app store.  I'll call this the 'platform'.The test accounts were loaded with $100K and that was used for the simulated crypto futures trades.After the testing, they declared the system stable enough that we could open our own accounts on that exchange.  I did so and funded the account with $2500 worth of ETH from Coinbase (minus fees etc).  Trades went well and I added more to the account - I added two instances of $10K.  Then I added $467K from Coinbase.  I also made a wire transfer of $500K that was deposited to my account on the platform.  I was able to trade that account up to $2.3M at which time I supposedly executed a trade wrong and the account was liquidated.  Lost that entire amount.I regrouped and was able to wire in another $250K to start over.  After a few days, it was offered that I could borrow from a P2P provider associated with the platform.  I 'borrowed' $250K.  From that $500K, I grew the account to $5.7M.Then the P2P loan service called my loan due and 'froze' my account until it was repaid.  I made an agreement with them that if I paid half (which included interest) they would request to have my account unfrozen whereby I would pay them the balance out of funds in my account.  This was $136500.  My account was opened but then it seemed the platform had detected some possible fraud with my account and had to do a security investigation during which time I wasn't able to move any money.  This meant I couldn't pay off my balance within the given time frame and P2P loan again froze my account.At this point, they told me if I didn't pay the balance they would take over my account.  It was somewhere between paying them the 1/2 and the refreezing of my account I decided it was a scam and basically quit contact.  I can't access my account anymore, though I am still a member of the active WhatsApp group.\n\nAfter reading about this, typical pig-butchering scam.
