	"description": "On November 22, 2025, cryptocurrency was stolen from two wallets that I had on my computer in soft wallets. I did not authorize these transactions and have not looked at these wallets in several months. The first unauthorized transaction was the attacker unstaked my Solana on November 20th. I only noticed this all today, December 6, 2025.The seed phrases for my Solana and Ethereum / Polygon wallets were stored in my NordPass password manager on my MacBook Air, and a NordPass recovery code was stored in a PDF in my Documents folder, which had been uploaded to iCloud Drive.I have not found evidence of obvious remote logins or malware, but based on the timing and the fact that my seed phrases and recovery code were stored on this device, I suspect my Mac, my NordPass vault, or the NordPass recovery code PDF may have been compromised.The hacker seemingly used my seed phrases stored in Nordpass to access my wallets, sent the funds to themselves through various transactions.I ran Malwarebytes scan and found no known malware on my computer.Transactions:Solana unstaking transactions:https://solscan.io/tx/jTYHSMQjCRHQ2RAPCDJhawi3bRxv3hreuyuMJrymXpBn3HQgyieboGJbA9Q2xGXHtPJKDp7Y8SEuFUz3BbinJQWhttps://solscan.io/tx/2eSgA1tkaJR9BBo6FfReBDUk3annje4DC33euZj9Sk79TkdEnFFKiBSRvLFKsCDzFEp7B72qyZ5mBT79ub8cPzj3https://solscan.io/tx/2Hu4ETjPRobxxcf26kLTBVpMLGw6Lw8NCDhGSZs5ru7ZebCEkSwJA3CHNpnacc7XsyoNxR9E8A44W7GpbVh5QoyDhttps://solscan.io/tx/oVm6j1WM1c6Zp3Ly7zTAQYunKxfccMdZAR5JZedX4gebx9bEnE2TRPZYctnwMqeoBu76VY31b38fN95keg4ep6qSolana transactions:Hacker converted HNT token to SOL on solana blockchain:https://solscan.io/tx/WxquWkNLXnWduHMDosT9Ws7tJRthB3hbXxSH6ZpgYqYNpAc6SCxRz9GGWSyrdBePZGUdGvrW9Zm6mQLZNSrX5kZHacker sent 66.38 SOL ($8K USD) to their own wallethttps://solscan.io/tx/67aD3EZcZEVgS1L1Ee7PatyBxQ6didhR8GfxfX82FnEYmJPFL9UqnF24X4SY2TLJUJv5heJhdJq8VRK7ED9mUEyJPolygon Blockchain:Hacker converted 0.281 WETH to MATIC (~$758.21)https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xc38a081f3b20b53edec1fccd1b1f5cdb1ae6f80e6c2d7ee01abbb765895111c7Hacker sent 5,984 MATIC to their wallet ($785.5)https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x55cc48109ef51ee0bd87fb9b7b17f129df10502b326ca8b86653277d4ff6f89dEthereum Blockchain:Hacker sent 0.25 ETH to their wallet ($677.71)https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3a983be96e998ae316061509f66606d2201154a426712352ebdc3cce6d95c549\n\nOn November 22, 2025, cryptocurrency was stolen from two wallets that I had on my computer in soft wallets.
