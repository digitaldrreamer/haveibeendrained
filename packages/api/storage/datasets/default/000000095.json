	"description": "My mother who is a former accountant helps to take care of the crypto accounts for the family. My personal ledger accounts were connected to her Ledger app on her laptop, as were the accounts for my other siblings.On Monday 3rd November I received a phone call from my mother saying that she had be contacted by a detective from Holborn Police Station. They claimed that they had caught a scammer that had collected her personal details including a copy of her drivers licence and her SEED phrase for her crypto accounts along with several other potential victims. They also reassured her that she didn't have to do anything more but wait for them to come back with more information while the investigation was ongoing.  She called me to make me aware of the situation but that I should be ok and to wait until further information. I was a little sceptical but saw that my accounts were still in tact so assumed it was nothing to do with me.Later I received another call from her asking if I had moved my crypto. I said no, and then she informed me that my accounts on her app were empty. I checked my accounts from my end and saw that everything had be emptied out completely within a few minutes.I then discovered that that she had also received a phone call from someone claiming to be from some kind of crypto security department where they help to secure crypto accounts on various platforms. They had encouraged her to secure her ledger accounts and guided her through the process. They got her to open her app on her laptop and got her to log in to a fake Ledger webpage called \"ledgerhelp.com\". On this page, they got her to create a new SEED phrase. somehow they were able to access the accounts on her Ledger app (including mine) through this process. She never used any of the Ledger USB-keys, although they apparently tried to get her to find my brothers ledger key, which she couldn't locate. They also did the same with her kraken account and coinable account. My older brother who also had a Ledger account linked to her app lost all his funds like myself. My mother had kraken crypto staked so it wasn't easily accessible. She also lost a chance of crypto funds from her coinbase account.Unfortunately, my mother wasn't acting in good faith to try an protect us all but was unfortunately greatly manipulated and tricked into giving the scammers the access they needed to steal our crypto. My mother has been very unstable and unclear ever since the event and specific details about the scamming process have been difficult to get a clear picture of.\n\nMy mother who is a former accountant helps to take care of the crypto accounts for the family.
