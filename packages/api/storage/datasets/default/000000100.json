But today I just happen to open my phantom wallet on November 4, 2025, and I see the balance is zero, I quickly see the transactions. I've kept some Solana and converted other remaining in USDT. There were two transections first was of converting my USDT to Solana and other was all my Solana was transfer to another wallet. The transaction was made on October 30, 2025. I haven't touched my wallet in like 6 months and the recovery phase is also in secure place. I don't know how they gain access to my wallet and did this robbery. I did have my wallet extension on my web browser so maybe they get to my browser and to my saved password/information. even though it's not a big amount for some but it was my savings Afterall. I'm no expert in tech world and I have faced this scam First time, so I'm somewhat freaked out. I hope this scammer/hacker caught fast ASAP. No one should face what I'm Going through. Stay safe and be aware these guys need tiny window to get to your device and wipe you off. Peace.\n\nNormally I don't open my wallet, so I just kept my crypto hoping one day it would go up!
